# The Library of Locked Weather

**Genre:** Near-future science fiction / mystery

**Premise:** In Harbor Seven, weather isn’t a fact of nature—it’s a licensed utility dispensed by a municipal algorithm and billed by the minute. When Mara Venn, a quiet maintenance tech for the city’s weather ducts, finds a sealed “Archive Line” carrying storms that were never paid for, she’s pulled into a hidden ledger of stolen forecasts, erased neighborhoods, and the people who still remember how rain used to be free.

## Outline
- Mara services a failing weather vent and hears thunder where none should exist.
- A pressure anomaly leads her to an unlisted access hatch labeled **ARCHIVE**.
- She siphons a sample: real rain, not the city’s distilled “mist allotment.”
- The Weather Office flags her badge for “unauthorized atmospheric handling.”
- An old forecaster named Haldane contacts her with a warning: “Don’t log what you found.”
- Mara learns the algorithm (CIRRUS) was trained on a corrupted climate history.
- The archive contains weather “debts” rerouted away from wealthy districts into silent zones.
- Mara traces the physical archive line to a subterranean library of spooled storms.
- Someone begins deleting maintenance records—and people tied to them—from the system.
- Mara must choose: restore the ledger (and unleash backlogged weather) or keep the city stable at the cost of truth.

## Chapter 1: Metered Sky

The sky over Harbor Seven was the color of an unpaid invoice.

Clouds were a premium add-on in District One. What hung over Mara’s commute to Vent Station 14 was regulated haze—flat light tuned for efficiency, the kind that kept shadows honest and solar arrays predictable.

At the station, the air smelled of warm plastic and ozone. Mara scanned her badge; a green ring flashed and the gate sighed open.

Inside, Vent Station 14 was an old structure from the early days, all angles and panels. The East Quay ducting ran overhead in segmented ribs, riveted and patched with newer polymer that didn’t match.

“Pressure drift again,” Juno said without looking up from the console. “You’re going to love this one.”

Mara set her tool roll on the bench and pulled on gloves. “Where?”

Juno’s chin tipped toward the overhead schematic, a moving ribbon of colored lines. “Line E-9. East Quay distribution. The drift starts at fourteen-oh-eight and gets worse the longer we keep the schedule.”

“A leak?”

“No moisture loss.” Juno’s mouth twitched. “That’s the thing. It’s… heavy. Like something’s sitting on it.”

Mara stared at the ribbon. E-9 should have been boring—standard mist, occasional breeze to keep cargo fumes from settling. Instead, the pressure graph showed a stubborn bulge, as if the air itself had gained weight.

“Has CIRRUS already compensated?” Mara asked.

“Tried. Kicked a counter-pulse at fifteen-oh-two,” Juno said. “Made it worse.”

Mara exhaled. “So it’s physical.”

“Or it’s haunted.” Juno spread her hands. “Pick your favorite explanation.”

They signed the work order—procedural theater for an algorithm that loved signatures—and Mara climbed to the access catwalk. The duct’s hum came up through her boots: metered wind.

She unfastened the nearest panel. Warm air breathed out, faintly of salt and disinfectant. Filters scrubbed out pollen, spores—anything “unpredictable.”

Mara slid her pressure wand into the duct and watched the readout climb.

“It’s wrong,” she muttered.

“How wrong?” Juno called up from the bay.

Mara tapped the casing with her knuckle as if the metal might confess. “It’s… dense. There’s mass in here that shouldn’t be here. Like—”

A low rumble rolled through the duct, so soft at first that Mara thought it was a freight lift on the lower level. Then it deepened, a long stomach-sound that made the rivets tremble.

Juno went still. “Did you—”

Mara froze with the wand half withdrawn. The rumble wasn’t mechanical. It had a texture. It had distance. It had the unmistakable architecture of thunder.

Thunder, in Harbor Seven, was not impossible—just priced out of most districts.

But this was inside the duct.

Mara pulled the wand out and wiped condensation from the sensor tip. Condensation. The city’s allotments ran dry by design; wet air meant mold, and mold didn’t invoice cleanly.

“There’s water,” she said.

Juno’s chair scraped. “No.”

Mara’s throat tightened. She leaned into the open panel and smelled again. Beneath the disinfectant was something sharp and mineral, a memory from before the rationing.

Petrichor.

Her hand found the duct’s seam and followed it along, searching for the nearest junction. The schematic said the next access was ten meters downline, a standard hatch marked with a bold E-9 stencil.

But there was a second seam, narrower and older, half-hidden under a maintenance brace. Mara rubbed grime away with her thumb until letters emerged, stamped shallow and uneven, as if someone didn’t want them found.

ARCHIVE.

Mara stared. “Juno,” she called, trying to keep her voice level. “Was there ever an Archive Line here?”

Juno climbed the ladder, boots clanging, breath quick. “What are you talking about?”

Mara pointed. Juno squinted, then swore softly.

“That’s not on any map,” Juno said. “That’s not—”

The duct rumbled again, closer now, and a single cold droplet fell from the open panel onto Mara’s wrist.

She flinched like it was a shock. The droplet sat on her skin, round and perfect, reflecting the station lights. It wasn’t distilled mist. It was heavier. It held its shape the way real rain did.

“If CIRRUS isn’t billing for this,” Juno whispered, “then where is it coming from?”

Mara watched the droplet roll toward her glove seam, slow as a thought turning into a decision. Beneath them, the station’s console chimed—an alert that meant someone, somewhere, had noticed.

Juno looked down at the bay.

Mara closed her fingers around the ARCHIVE seam, feeling the hidden latch under her palm. The metal was cold, colder than any regulated airflow had a right to be.

Outside, the city kept its scheduled haze.

Inside the duct, thunder waited.
