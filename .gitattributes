# Protect CLAUDE.md on each branch during merges.
# When merging dev → main (or vice versa), the target branch keeps its own CLAUDE.md.
# This uses the "ours" merge driver: `git config merge.ours.driver true`
# IMPORTANT: Always merge with --no-ff to ensure the merge driver is invoked.
CLAUDE.md merge=ours
