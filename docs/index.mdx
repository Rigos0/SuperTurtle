# Super Turtle Docs

Super Turtle is an autonomous coding system you control from Telegram.
You describe outcomes, and the system handles decomposition, execution,
and supervision.

<Warning>
Platform status: macOS is fully supported, Linux is untested alpha, and Windows is not an officially supported setup target right now. See [Platform Support](/config/platform-support).

## Key Principles

- Outcome-first UX: milestone updates, minimal noise
- Autonomous execution: SubTurtles run and recover without micromanagement
- Cost-aware routing: defaults to `yolo-codex`, escalates only when needed
