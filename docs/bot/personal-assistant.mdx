# Using Claude as a Personal Assistant

Claude Code is a powerful AI coding agent, but it's actually a very capable **general-purpose assistant** when given the right instructions, context, and tools. This guide shows how to use the Telegram bot to access Claude as your personal assistant from anywhere.

## The Core Idea

Instead of building a separate "assistant app," you:

1. Create a **personal working folder** with a `CLAUDE.md` that teaches Claude about you
2. Connect it to the bot via `CLAUDE_WORKING_DIR`
3. Add scripts, MCP tools, and Skills to extend Claude's capabilities
4. Access everything from Telegram, on your phone

Claude then becomes your 24/7 assistant that knows your preferences, goals, and workflows.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create Your Personal Folder

```bash
# Create a folder for your assistant setup
mkdir ~/my-assistant
cd ~/my-assistant

# Initialize git (optional but recommended)
git init
```

### Step 2: Write CLAUDE.md

Create `CLAUDE.md` in this folder. This is Claude's "brain" — it teaches Claude about you:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude as my personal assistant.

## Quick Reference

**This folder:**
- `cli/` - Utility scripts
- `.claude/skills/` - Task workflows
- `.claude/agents/` - Specialized subagents

**Key paths:**
- Notes: `~/Documents/Notes/` (personal, health, research, etc.)
- Working dir: `~/my-assistant`

## About Me

[Your name] is a [profession] interested in [hobbies/interests].

**Personal context**: See `personal-context.md` for details about family, preferences, goals.

## How to Assist

- **Autonomy**: Handle routine tasks independently
- **Communication style**: [Your preferred style]
- **Format preference**: Bullet lists over tables
- **When to ask**: Before significant actions, big purchases, or writing to permanent files

## Important Tasks

**Keep context fresh**: When you learn something new about me, update:
- Personal goals → `personal-context.md`
- Life priorities → `pulse.md`
- Assistant behavior → this `CLAUDE.md`

## Quick Lookup

- Life goals → `personal-context.md`
- Notes system → `~/Documents/Notes/`
- Tasks → Things 3 (via MCP)
```

### Step 3: Configure the Bot

Set your working directory in `.env`:

```bash
CLAUDE_WORKING_DIR=~/my-assistant
```

Now when the bot runs, Claude will read your `CLAUDE.md` and use it as context for every conversation.

## Building Assistant Features

### Scripts and Utilities

Create `cli/` scripts for tasks Claude should automate:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cli/health.sh
# Get health metrics from Health Auto Export

jq '.current' ~/Library/Health/Export/*.json | \
  jq -s 'add | {sleep, activity, vitals}'
```

Call from Telegram:

```
You: Check my health metrics
Claude: (runs cli/health.sh, sees sleep/activity/vitals)
Claude: Your sleep has been solid at 7.5h average.
        Resting HR at 52 (good), HRV at 71 (improving).
```

### Skills (Auto-Triggered Workflows)

Skills are workflows that Claude can use automatically when relevant. Create them in `.claude/skills/`:

```markdown
---
name: workout-planning
description: Create personalized workouts based on training plan and recent activity
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Bash(cli/health.sh:*), Glob
---

# Workout Planning

When asked for a workout or exercise routine:

1. **Read training plan**: `~/Documents/Notes/Health/training.md`
2. **Check recent workouts**: `~/Documents/Notes/Health/Workouts/`
3. **Get health metrics**: Run `cli/health.sh`
4. **Propose workout** based on training schedule and recovery
5. **Create** `Health/Workouts/YYYY-MM-DD-workout.md`

Format workouts as clear, numbered lists with exercise names, sets/reps, and rest periods.
```

Now when you ask "give me a workout", Claude automatically:
- Reads your training plan
- Checks your recent activity and recovery
- Creates a personalized workout file
- You see it instantly in your notes app (if synced via iCloud)

### MCP Servers for Tools

Connect Claude to your favorite apps via MCP. Common setups:

**Things 3** (macOS to-do manager):
```typescript
// mcp-config.ts
things: {
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@soulmen/things-mcp"],
  env: {
    THINGS_DATABASE_PATH: `${require("os").homedir()}/Library/CloudStorage/iCloud~com~culturedcode~things/Things Database.thingsdatabase`,
  },
},
```

Now ask: "Add 'Review design specs' to my inbox"

**Notion** (notes and databases):
```typescript
notion: {
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@github/notion-mcp"],
  env: {
    NOTION_API_KEY: process.env.NOTION_API_KEY || "",
  },
},
```

Now ask: "What's on my reading list?" and Claude queries your Notion database.

**Slack** (team communication):
```typescript
slack: {
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@slackhq/slack-mcp"],
  env: {
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN || "",
  },
},
```

Now ask: "Catch me up on what the team has been doing" and Claude reads recent Slack messages.

## Example Workflows

### Morning Briefing

Create a `/life-pulse` command that gathers data from multiple sources:

```markdown
---
name: life-pulse
description: Generate executive life digest
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Write, Task
---

# Generate Life Pulse

Gather data in parallel:
- Things: Today's tasks and upcoming
- Email: Unread and important
- Health: Sleep and recovery metrics
- Calendar: Upcoming events
- Work: Issues and blockers (if connected)

Synthesize into a brief digest covering:
- **TL;DR** - What's on your plate (3-5 bullets)
- **Now** - What needs attention right now
- **Health** - Sleep quality, activity, recovery
- **Next** - Upcoming priorities

Write to `~/Documents/Notes/life-pulse.md`
```

When you run this from Telegram, Claude:
1. Gathers all data in parallel
2. Synthesizes into a readable briefing
3. Saves to a file synced to your phone via iCloud
4. You read it with coffee every morning

### Research and Decisions

Create a `research` skill for thorough decision-making:

```markdown
---
name: research
description: Research topics using web search, Reddit, and Hacker News
allowed-tools: WebSearch, WebFetch, Bash, Read, Write
---

# Research Workflow

When asked to research:

1. Search the web for reviews and expert opinions
2. Search Reddit for community experiences
3. Search Hacker News for tech/startup discussions
4. Synthesize findings with pros/cons
5. Save to `~/Documents/Notes/Research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`

Provide clear recommendation based on actual data, not guesses.
```

Message: "Research the best noise-canceling headphones under $300"

Claude searches multiple sources, compares options, and saves a detailed recommendation to your Notes.

## File Sync Strategy

**Best practice:** Sync your Notes folder to your phone via iCloud:

```bash
# On macOS
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Notes
# Enable iCloud sync: System Settings → iCloud Drive → Documents
```

Now files Claude creates appear on your phone instantly. Use [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) or [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) to edit them on the go.

**For Things 3 tasks**: They sync automatically once Claude adds them.

**For Notion**: Updates sync through the Notion app.

## Security & Permissions

<Note>
The bot runs Claude Code with **all permission prompts disabled**. This is intentional for a seamless mobile experience, but you should understand it means Claude can:
- Read and write files in allowed directories
- Execute shell commands without confirmation
- Access external tools and APIs

See [Security](/docs/config/security) for defense layers in place.
</Note>

**Set restrictive file access:**

In `.env`:
```bash
# Only allow your assistant folder and notes
ALLOWED_PATHS=~/my-assistant,~/Documents/Notes,~/.claude
```

Claude can't access other directories, protecting sensitive files.

## Progressive Enhancement

Start simple and expand as you build confidence:

**Week 1:** Basic CLAUDE.md + answer questions
```
You: What's my next meeting?
Claude: Checking calendar... 2pm standup
```

**Week 2:** Add one script (e.g., health.sh)
```
You: How did I sleep last night?
Claude: (runs health.sh, sees sleep data)
```

**Week 3:** Connect first MCP (Things 3)
```
You: Add project review to my inbox
Claude: ✅ Added to Things
```

**Week 4:** Create first Skill (workout planning)
```
You: Give me a workout for today
Claude: (reads training plan, creates workout file)
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Subagents for Complex Tasks

For complex tasks like "generate my life pulse", use **subagents** that run in parallel with separate context windows:

```
Main Agent Task: "Give me a life pulse"
  ↓
  Subagent 1: Gather email digest
  Subagent 2: Gather task digest
  Subagent 3: Gather health digest
  Subagent 4: Gather work digest
  ↓
  Main agent synthesizes into final briefing
```

This keeps context windows lean and lets you handle complex workflows.

### Calendar Sync via GitHub Gist

Manage calendars that sync to your phone:

```bash
# calendars/track-days.yaml (auto-generated by Claude)
events:
  - date: "2026-01-25"
    title: "Track day at Portimão"
    time: "09:00"
    # syncs to GitHub Gist
    # you subscribe in Google Calendar / Apple Calendar
```

Message: "Add the Belgium race to my calendar for next Saturday"

Claude updates the YAML file, syncs to GitHub, and your calendar refreshes automatically.
