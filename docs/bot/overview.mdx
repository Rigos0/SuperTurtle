# Telegram Bot Overview

The Claude Telegram Bot turns [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) into your personal assistant, accessible from anywhere via Telegram. Send messages, voice, photos, documents, and video — Claude processes everything in real-time and you see responses instantly.

## Why Use This Bot

- Ask questions and get answers instantly
- Give instructions and see Claude work in real-time
- Send screenshots and documents for analysis
- Use voice for natural interaction
- Stay productive from anywhere

## How It Works

```
You (Telegram)
    ↓
Bot receives message (text/voice/photo/document/video)
    ↓
Claude Code processes it
    ↓
Response sent back to Telegram
```

When you send a message:
1. Bot receives and validates your user ID
2. Message is sent to Claude Code
3. Claude can use tools, read files, execute commands (within allowed paths)
4. Response streams back to you in real-time
5. You see Claude's work as it happens

## What You Control

Claude runs with all permission prompts disabled (for seamless mobile experience), but you control **what Claude can access**:

- **File access:** Limited to directories you specify
- **Commands:** Dangerous patterns like `rm -rf /` are blocked
- **Rate limiting:** Prevents runaway usage
- **Audit logging:** All interactions are logged

See [Security](/docs/config/security) for the full threat model and defense layers.
