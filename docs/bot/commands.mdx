# Bot Commands

This page reflects the current implementation in:
- `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/index.ts`
- `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/handlers/commands.ts`

## Registered Slash Commands

These commands are currently wired with `bot.command(...)` in `index.ts`.

| Slash command | Aliases | What it does |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/new` | none | Resets both drivers (stopping active work), starts a fresh session overview |
| `/status` | none | Shows the same overview as `/new` without resetting sessions |
| `/looplogs` | none | Sends the last 50 lines from the raw run-loop log (`/tmp/claude-telegram-bot-ts.log`) |
| `/pinologs` | none | Shows log-level buttons (Info/Warning/Errors) for filtered Pino logs (`/tmp/claude-telegram-bot.log.jsonl`) |
| `/usage` | none | Shows unified Claude + Codex quota/usage (when available) |
| `/context` | none | Shows Claude context usage for the active Claude session |
| `/model` | none | Opens model/effort picker for the active driver |
| `/switch` | none | Switches active driver (`claude` or `codex`) |
| `/resume` | none | Unified picker across Claude + Codex sessions, with a `Continue current` button and compact driver-tagged entries |
| `/sub` | `/subs`, `/subturtle`, `/subturtles`, `/turtle`, `/turtles` | Shows SubTurtle status with task/backlog summary and state/stop buttons |
| `/cron` | none | Lists scheduled jobs with cancel buttons |
| `/debug` | none | Shows internal diagnostics (driver/session/queue/background status) |
| `/restart` | none | Restarts the bot process via restart marker + exit |

## Stop Intents (Command-Like)

These are handled as stop intents in text handling (not via `bot.command(...)` registrations):

- `/stop`
- `/pause`
- `/abort`
- `!` (single character)
- Natural language variants recognized by `isStopIntent(...)` (for example, `please stop now`)

When matched, the bot stops active driver work and attempts to stop running SubTurtles.

## Notes

- `/cron` does **not** currently have a `/jobs` slash alias in source.
- Use `/looplogs` for raw launcher/runtime output (`live.sh` + `run-loop.sh`, stdout/stderr).
- Use `/pinologs` for structured app logs when you need level/module filtering.
- Programmatic control-plane operations (usage/model/driver/session/restart) are documented in [MCP Tools](/docs/bot/mcp-tools) under `bot_control`.
