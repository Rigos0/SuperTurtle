# Bot Commands

All commands are available as `/command` in Telegram. Many also have shorter intents (e.g., `stop` instead of `/stop`).

## Command Reference

| Command | Intent | Description | Returns |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `/new` | `new` | Start a fresh session | Session ID, current model/effort settings, and available commands |
| `/resume` | `resume` | Pick from last 5 sessions to resume | List of recent sessions with recaps; select one to restore context |
| `/status` | `status` | Check what Claude is doing | Detailed task status, current SubTurtles if any, next job time, git status |
| `/model` | `model` | Switch model or reasoning effort | List of available models; select one and optionally set effort level |
| `/switch` | `switch` | Toggle between Claude Code and Codex | Confirmation of driver switch with new model info |
| `/usage` | `usage` | Show subscription usage | Claude Code token usage, Codex usage (if enabled), quota status |
| `/context` | `context` | Show context usage | Tokens used in current session, remaining context window |
| `/stop` | `stop, pause, abort, !` | Interrupt current query | Confirms work stopped; stops active SubTurtles |
| `/sub` | `subs, subtitles` | List SubTurtles | Table of running SubTurtles: status, type, task, tunnel URL (if preview available) |
| `/cron` | `jobs` | Show scheduled jobs | List of scheduled tasks: next run time, cron expression, status |
| `/looplogs` | `logs` | Show last 50 lines of main loop log | Tail of `/tmp/claude-telegram-bot-ts.log` for debugging |
| `/restart` | `restart` | Restart the bot | Stops bot cleanly and restarts it; sessions persist |

## Global Stop Intents

Even without a command prefix, Claude recognizes these as stop requests:

- `stop`
- `pause`
- `abort`
- `!` (single character)
- Voice transcripts of the above

These work **anywhere in your message** and take priority. If Claude is working, sending any of these will interrupt immediately.

## Interactive Commands

### /new — Start Fresh

Clears context and starts a new session. Useful when you want to switch topics or reset Claude's understanding.

Returns:
- New session ID
- Current model and reasoning effort
- List of available commands

### /model — Switch Model or Effort

Opens a menu to select your preferred model:

- **Claude models:** Sonnet (default), Opus, Haiku
- **Reasoning effort:** High, Medium, Low (Sonnet/Opus only; Haiku doesn't support reasoning)

Example:
```
You: /model
Bot: [Inline buttons: Sonnet, Opus, Haiku]
You: [Tap Sonnet]
Bot: [Inline buttons: ⚡ High, 🟡 Medium, 💨 Low]
You: [Tap High]
Bot: ✅ Switched to Sonnet (High effort)
```

### /switch — Toggle Drivers

Switches between Claude Code and Codex. Requires `CODEX_ENABLED=true` in configuration.

Example:
```
You: /switch
Bot: Switched to Codex (Claude 4.0) | workspace-write sandbox
```

### /resume — Pick a Recent Session

Shows your last 5 sessions with brief recaps. Tap one to restore its context.

Each session shows:
- Session ID (first 8 chars)
- Recap (first ~100 chars of what was discussed)
- Timestamp

Useful for continuing work without saying `/new`.

### /status — Detailed Status

Shows everything happening right now:

- Current model and driver (Claude Code or Codex)
- Token usage in current session
- Any running SubTurtles (name, status, task, time remaining)
- Next scheduled check-in time
- Recent git log (if in a git repo)

### /context — Token Usage

Displays:
- Tokens used so far in this session
- Remaining context window
- Percentage of context used (color-coded: 🟢 under 50%, 🟡 50-80%, 🔴 over 80%)

When context gets full, you'll see a warning. Use `/new` to start fresh.

### /usage — Subscription Usage

Shows subscription status:

**Claude Code usage (always shown):**
- Tokens used this month
- Subscription quota
- Usage trend (last 7 days)

**Codex usage (if `CODEX_ENABLED=true`):**
- Requests used this billing period
- Estimated tokens (parsed from local Codex history)
- Active CLOTH subscription status

Both are refreshed every time you run the command.

### /sub — List SubTurtles

Shows all currently running SubTurtles (parallel agents spawned for complex tasks):

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Status** | `running`, `paused`, `waiting` |
| **Type** | `slow`, `yolo`, or `yolo-codex` (loop type) |
| **Task** | First line of the SubTurtle's current task |
| **Tunnel URL** | Live preview link (if frontend available) |
| **Time Remaining** | Estimated time until completion |

Aliases: `/subs`, `/subtitles`

### /cron — Show Scheduled Jobs

Lists all scheduled work:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Job** | Task name |
| **Next Run** | When it executes next |
| **Interval** | How often it runs (cron expression) |
| **Status** | `scheduled`, `running`, `completed`, `failed` |

Useful for monitoring background work and checking if something is stuck.

### /looplogs — Main Loop Logs

Tails the last 50 lines of `/tmp/claude-telegram-bot-ts.log` (the bot's main run loop).

Use this to debug issues:
- Is the bot actually running?
- Are there connection errors?
- Did something crash?

Example output:
```
[14:32:15] Listening on 127.0.0.1:3000
[14:32:18] Message from user 123456: "build me a site"
[14:32:19] Spawning SubTurtle: frontend-builder
[14:33:45] SubTurtle frontend-builder completed
[14:33:46] Tunnel live at https://abc123.trycloudflare.com
```

### /restart — Restart the Bot

Gracefully restarts the bot process. Sessions persist across restarts.

Use when:
- Bot seems stuck
- You updated configuration and want to reload
- You want to refresh connections

## Message Prefixes

Prefix your message with `!` to send it **immediately**, interrupting any running work:

```
You: (Claude is thinking...)
You: ! What time is it?
```

Claude stops the current work and responds to your question.

## Context and State

All commands respect the current session context:

- `/model` changes affect all future messages in this session
- `/switch` changes affect which driver processes your messages
- `/new` completely resets context (but keeps session history in `/resume`)
- `/context` shows usage for this session only

Context resets when:
1. You run `/new`
2. You exceed the model's max context window (usually ~100k tokens)
3. You start a fresh `/resume` from an old session
