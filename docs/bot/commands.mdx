# Bot Commands

This page reflects the current implementation in:
- `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/index.ts`
- `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/handlers/commands.ts`

## Registered Slash Commands

These commands are currently wired with `bot.command(...)` in `index.ts`.

| Slash command | Aliases | What it does |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/new` | none | Resets both drivers (stopping active work), starts a fresh session overview |
| `/status` | none | Shows the same overview as `/new` without resetting sessions |
| `/looplogs` | none | Sends the last 50 lines from `/tmp/claude-telegram-bot-ts.log` |
| `/usage` | none | Shows unified Claude + Codex quota/usage (when available) |
| `/context` | none | Shows Claude context usage for the active Claude session |
| `/model` | none | Opens model/effort picker for the active driver |
| `/switch` | none | Switches active driver (`claude` or `codex`) |
| `/resume` | none | Shows up to 20 saved sessions and lets you resume one |
| `/sub` | `/subs`, `/subturtle`, `/subturtles`, `/turtle`, `/turtles` | Shows SubTurtle status with task/backlog summary and state/stop buttons |
| `/cron` | none | Lists scheduled jobs with cancel buttons |

## Stop Intents (Command-Like)

These are handled as stop intents in text handling (not via `bot.command(...)` registrations):

- `/stop`
- `/pause`
- `/abort`
- `!` (single character)
- Natural language variants recognized by `isStopIntent(...)` (for example, `please stop now`)

When matched, the bot stops active driver work and attempts to stop running SubTurtles.

## Implemented in `commands.ts` But Not Registered as Slash Commands

The following handlers exist in `handlers/commands.ts` but are not currently wired in `index.ts` via `bot.command(...)`:

| Command | Status | Behavior |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `/debug` | Implemented handler, not slash-registered | Builds an internal diagnostics snapshot (driver/session/background queue/deferred queue/log error summary) |
| `/restart` | Implemented handler, not slash-registered | Writes restart marker info and exits so the process can be relaunched |

## Notes

- `/cron` does **not** currently have a `/jobs` slash alias in source.
- Programmatic control-plane operations (usage/model/driver/session/restart) are documented in [MCP Tools](/docs/bot/mcp-tools) under `bot_control`.
