## macOS

### Supported Versions

- macOS 12 (Monterey) and later
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) and Intel processors

### Recommended Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Bun">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Claude Code">
    Download from [claude.com/product/claude-code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone and configure">
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd claude-telegram-bot
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your credentials
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up as LaunchAgent">
    See [Running as a Service](/docs/bot/running-as-service) for details
  </Step>
</Steps>

### macOS-Specific Features

**Keychain Integration**

Claude Code uses macOS Keychain to securely store credentials:

- Telegram bot token
- Anthropic API key
- OpenAI API key

These are automatically managed and encrypted by Keychain. No extra setup needed.

**Path Handling**

macOS has special paths for temp files:

```bash
# These are always allowed
/tmp/               # Temporary directory
/var/folders/       # System temp (symlink target)
/private/tmp/       # Private temp (real path for /tmp)
```

The bot automatically handles symlinks and path resolution.

**Sleep Prevention**

Use `caffeinate` to keep the Mac awake:

```bash
# Prevent sleep while bot runs
caffeinate -i bun run src/index.ts
```

Or set in LaunchAgent:

```xml
<key>KeepAlive</key>
<true/>
```

The LaunchAgent will restart the bot if it crashes and keep it running 24/7.

**Homebrew Paths**

Homebrew installs to platform-specific locations:

```bash
# Apple Silicon (recommended location)
/opt/homebrew/bin    # Most common, auto-detected

# Intel Mac
/usr/local/bin       # Common for older installs
```

The bot auto-detects these paths. If you get "command not found" errors, add to your `.env`:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

### Known Limitations

- File paths with Unicode characters may have issues (rare)
- Very long file paths (>250 chars) may hit system limits
- Network-mounted volumes can be slow for file operations

## Linux

### Supported Distributions

Tested on:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and later
- Debian 12+
- Fedora 37+
- Arch Linux

Should work on most modern Linux distros with Bun support.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install -y curl git build-essential

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install -y curl git make gcc

# Arch
sudo pacman -S base-devel git
```

### Recommended Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Bun">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Claude Code (optional)">
    Claude Code doesn't have a native Linux app, but the SDK works fine with API key auth:
    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone and configure">
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd claude-telegram-bot
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your credentials
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up as systemd service">
    See [Running as a Service](/docs/bot/running-as-service) for details
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Linux-Specific Features

**systemd Integration**

Systemd services are the Linux equivalent of macOS LaunchAgents:

```bash
# Copy template
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp systemd/superturtle-bot.service.template \
   ~/.config/systemd/user/superturtle-bot.service

# Edit and enable
nano ~/.config/systemd/user/superturtle-bot.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now superturtle-bot

# Monitor
journalctl --user -u superturtle-bot -f
```

**User-Level Services**

User services run without root and have per-user configuration:

```bash
# User service (no root needed)
~/.config/systemd/user/superturtle-bot.service
journalctl --user -u superturtle-bot

# System-wide service (requires root)
/etc/systemd/system/superturtle-bot.service
sudo journalctl -u superturtle-bot
```

For a personal bot, use user services.

**Sleep Prevention**

Use `systemd-inhibit` to prevent system sleep:

```bash
# Prevent sleep while command runs
systemd-inhibit --why="Bot running" sleep infinity &

# Or in systemd service:
ExecStartPre=/bin/systemd-inhibit --what=sleep --why="Bot running"
```

**Homebrew/Linuxbrew**

If using Linuxbrew (community Homebrew for Linux):

```bash
# Default Linuxbrew paths
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin
```

The bot auto-detects these. If not found, add to `.env`:

```bash
PATH=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH
```

### Claude Code on Linux

Claude Code has a native Linux app (beta). To use it:

1. Install from [claude.com/product/claude-code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)
2. Run `claude auth` once
3. The bot automatically detects it

If not available, use API key auth instead:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Known Limitations

- Some Codex features may not work without the Codex app
- File permissions can be complex on shared systems
- SELinux may require special configuration for file access

## Windows

### Setup with Git Bash

Windows is supported via **Git Bash**, which provides a Unix-like environment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install prerequisites">
    1. [Install Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (includes Git Bash)
    2. [Install Bun for Windows](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
    3. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if Bun has issues)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    Open Git Bash and run:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd claude-telegram-bot
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your credentials
    nano .env
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the bot">
    ```bash
    bun run start
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Running as a Service on Windows

**Option 1: Task Scheduler** (simplest)

```powershell
# Create task
$TaskPath = "\Claude Telegram Bot"
$TaskName = "BotService"

# Define action
$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "C:\path\to\bun.exe" `
  -Argument "run C:\path\to\bot\src\index.ts" `
  -WorkingDirectory "C:\path\to\bot"

# Create trigger (on boot and every 5 min if stopped)
$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtStartup

# Register task
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName $TaskName -Action $Action `
  -Trigger $Trigger -RunLevel Highest
```

**Option 2: NSSM** (Non-Sucking Service Manager)

```bash
# Download from nssm.cc
nssm install BotService C:\path\to\bun.exe "run C:\path\to\bot\src\index.ts"
nssm start BotService
nssm status BotService
```

**Option 3: Windows Service** (advanced)

Use [winsw](https://github.com/winsw/winsw) for more control.

### Windows-Specific Considerations

**Path Handling**

Windows uses backslashes, but Git Bash uses forward slashes:

```bash
# Git Bash (use forward slashes)
ALLOWED_PATHS=C:/Users/USERNAME/my-assistant,C:/Users/USERNAME/Documents

# Not: C:\Users\USERNAME (this won't work in .env)
```

**Command Execution**

Shell commands run in Git Bash (POSIX environment), not PowerShell:

```bash
# Works in Git Bash
ls -la
cd /c/Users/USERNAME

# Won't work (PowerShell syntax)
dir
Get-ChildItem
```

If you need PowerShell, wrap it:

```bash
powershell -Command "Get-ChildItem"
```

**Claude Code Availability**

Claude Code doesn't have a native Windows app yet. Use API key auth:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

**Codex Support**

Codex requires the Codex app, which is Windows-compatible but the setup is more complex. For Windows, use Claude Code (via API key) instead.

### Known Limitations

- LaunchAgent/systemd features don't apply (use Task Scheduler instead)
- Sleep prevention is limited (Task Scheduler doesn't have equiv to caffeinate)
- Some shell commands may not work (Git Bash is not full POSIX)
- Codex integration is less reliable
- File path handling can be tricky (forward vs backslashes)

<Warning>
**Windows support is community-maintained.** If you encounter issues specific to Windows, please report them and we'll prioritize fixes.
</Warning>

- You're comfortable with systemd
- You want full control over the environment

**Use Windows if:**
- You primarily use Windows
- You need native Windows integration
- You can work around Git Bash limitations

## Troubleshooting by Platform

### macOS

**"command not found: bun"**

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.bun/bin
# Add to ~/.zshrc for permanent
```

**"Claude Code not found"**

```bash
# Ensure Claude Code is installed and authenticated
claude auth

# If still not found, use API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Linux

**"systemd service won't start"**

```bash
# Check status
systemctl --user status superturtle-bot

# View errors
journalctl --user -u superturtle-bot -n 50

# Reload daemon
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

**Permission denied on file operations**

```bash
# Check file ownership
ls -la /path/to/file

# May need to adjust ALLOWED_PATHS or file permissions
chmod u+rw /path/to/file
```

### Windows

**"bun is not recognized"**

```bash
# Install Bun and add to PATH
# Or use full path
C:\path\to\bun.exe run ...

# Verify installation
bun --version
```

**"Path not found"**

```bash
# Use forward slashes in .env even on Windows
ALLOWED_PATHS=C:/Users/YOU/my-assistant
```
