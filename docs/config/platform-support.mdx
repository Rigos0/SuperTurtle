# Platform Support

This project is currently optimized for local-first onboarding via agent-driven setup.

## Current Status

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | ✅ Fully supported | Primary target for onboarding + daily use |
| Linux | ⚠️ Untested alpha | May work, but not validated end-to-end |
| Windows | ❌ Not officially supported | No maintained onboarding path right now |

## Why macOS is the primary target

- The default launch flow (`bun run start`) relies on `tmux` and macOS-focused sleep behavior guidance.
- Team validation and day-to-day testing currently happen on macOS.
- Onboarding UX is tuned for the macOS laptop workflow.

## Linux expectations (alpha)

Linux can still be used, but treat it as experimental:

- You may hit environment or service-management issues not covered by onboarding automation.
- If setup fails, you may need manual debugging and local adaptations.

## Laptop sleep behavior (important)

On Mac laptops, long-running bot sessions are sensitive to sleep/lid behavior:

1. Enable `System Settings -> Battery -> Options -> Prevent automatic sleeping when the display is off` (on power adapter).
2. Keep the lid open while the bot is running.

## Setup model

The supported setup path is the guided flow in [Quickstart](/quickstart):

1. Clone repo.
2. Open Claude Code or Codex.
3. Prompt: `Set up Super Turtle for me.`

The onboarding agent handles BotFather/user-id guidance, setup command execution, and startup verification.
