---

# Quickstart

Super Turtle setup is agent-guided. You do not need to manually wire config files.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed and authenticated
- A machine you can keep awake while the bot runs (macOS is fully supported; Linux is untested alpha)

You do **not** need a Telegram token in advance. The onboarding agent will walk you through creating one.

<Warning>
Before running setup, check [Platform Support](/config/platform-support). macOS is fully supported; Linux is untested alpha.
</Warning>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repo">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rigos0/superturtle.git
    cd superturtle
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Claude Code or Codex">
    ```bash
    claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
    # or
    codex --full-auto
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prompt the onboarding flow">
    ```text
    Set up Super Turtle for me.
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What the onboarding agent should do

The onboarding flow should be fully guided and step-by-step:

1. Guide BotFather flow (`@BotFather` -> `/newbot`) and collect token.
2. Guide Telegram user ID flow (`@userinfobot`) and collect numeric ID.
3. Ask whether to enable voice transcription, optionally collect `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
4. Run setup command:
   - `./super_turtle/setup --driver auto --telegram-token "<token>" --telegram-user "<id>"`
   - Add `--openai-api-key "<key>"` if provided.
5. Start bot:
   - `cd super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot && bun run start`
6. Ask user to send `/start` (or any message) in Telegram and confirm response.

If the environment supports it, onboarding should use interactive choice prompts (for example via `ask_user`) for yes/no decisions.

<Warning>
Do not commit `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/.env`. It contains local credentials.
</Warning>

## Reliability notes for Mac laptops

- Enable `System Settings -> Battery -> Options -> Prevent automatic sleeping when the display is off` (on power adapter).
- Keep the lid open while the bot is running.
