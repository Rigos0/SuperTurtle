# Quickstart

Set up Super Turtle and start coding from Telegram. The setup is AI-guided — you provide secrets, the system does the rest.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Git** — to clone the repo
- **Bun 1.0+** — [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/) (lightweight JavaScript runtime)
- **Claude Code or Codex CLI** — Either is fine; the system auto-detects
  - Claude Code: [Install from claude.com](https://claude.com/download)
  - Codex: [Install from codeium.com](https://www.codeium.com/download)
- **Telegram bot token** — Created via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- **Your Telegram user ID** — Available from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
- **OpenAI API key** (optional) — Only needed if you want voice transcription

<Tip>
Don't have a Telegram bot token yet? Create one now in 30 seconds:
1. Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
3. Save the token (looks like `123456:ABCdefGHIjklmnoPQRstuvWXYZ`)
</Tip>

## Setup Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rigos0/superturtle.git
    cd superturtle
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Claude Code or Codex at repo root">
    ```bash
    # Open Claude Code
    claude

    # OR open Codex
    codex
    ```

    You should see the repo root in your editor, with `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` visible in the file tree.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Say the setup prompt">
    In the chat, send:
    ```
    Set up Super Turtle on this machine.
    ```

    Claude will guide you through the setup wizard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide your credentials">
    When Claude asks, provide:
    - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` — From [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
    - `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` — Your Telegram user ID (find it via [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional) — Only if you want voice transcription

    <Note>
    The setup wizard will NOT ask for these in the chat. Instead, it will run a terminal command that opens a setup dialog where you enter them securely.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for setup to complete">
    The setup wizard will:
    - Install dependencies (via Bun)
    - Create `.env` file with your credentials
    - Configure the bot's default driver (Claude Code or Codex)
    - Register cron jobs for supervision

    This takes 1-2 minutes. Let it finish without interrupting.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Telegram bot">
    ```bash
    cd super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot
    bun run start
    ```

    You should see output like:
    ```
    ✓ Bot started
    ✓ Listening for messages
    ```

    The bot is now running. You can minimize this terminal — it will keep running in the background via `tmux`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Message your bot on Telegram">
    Open Telegram, find your bot (you named it in step 1 with BotFather), and send a message:
    ```
    /start
    ```

    You should see your user ID and bot status. If that works, try:
    ```
    Build me a simple HTML landing page.
    ```

    Watch as the system decomposes the task, spawns workers, and delivers results.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Bot Commands

Once the bot is running, these commands are available:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/start` | Show status and confirm your user ID |
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation |
| `/resume` | Pick from recent sessions to continue where you left off |
| `/context` | Show how much of your context quota you've used |
| `/stop` | Stop the current task (or just type `stop`) |
| `/status` | Check what Claude is doing right now |
| `/looplogs` | Show the last 50 lines of bot logs |
| `/restart` | Restart the bot |

## BotFather Configuration (Optional)

To add command hints to your bot's Telegram UI, go back to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and send:

```
/setcommands
```

Then paste this list:

```
start - Show status and user ID
new - Start a fresh session
resume - Pick from recent sessions
context - Show context usage
stop - Interrupt current query
status - Check what Claude is doing
looplogs - Show bot logs
restart - Restart the bot
```

This makes the commands appear as suggestions when you tap `/` in the Telegram chat.

## What's Next

✅ **Now that Super Turtle is running:**

- Try building something simple (a function, a script, a webpage)
- Use `/status` to check progress on longer tasks
- Message with `/stop` if you want to interrupt a task
- Check `/context` to see your quota usage

📖 **To understand how the system works:**
- Read [Architecture](/docs/architecture) for details on Meta Agents, SubTurtles, and supervision
- See [Bot Features](/docs/bot/overview) for command details and advanced options
- Check [SubTurtle Loop Types](/docs/subturtles/loop-types) to understand the different worker strategies

<Warning>
**First run:** The setup wizard will create `.env` in `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/`. This file contains your Telegram token and is **gitignored** for security. Never commit it.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't respond to messages**
- Verify your Telegram user ID is correct: send `/start` and check the ID shown
- Confirm the bot token was set correctly in `.env`
- Restart the bot: Ctrl+C in the terminal, then `bun run start` again
- Check logs: `tail -f /tmp/claude-telegram-bot-ts.log`

**Claude authentication fails**
- For Claude Code: run `claude` in a terminal and verify you're logged in
- For Codex: run `codex` and verify you're logged in
- Check that your subscription is active

**Voice messages fail**
- Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Verify the key is valid at [OpenAI console](https://platform.openai.com/)

**Setup wizard got stuck**
- Press Ctrl+C to exit and try again
- Verify Bun is installed: `bun --version`
- Check that Claude/Codex CLI is in your PATH: `which claude` or `which codex`
