# Quickstart

Super Turtle setup is AI-guided. You clone, open an agent, and tell it to set up. It handles the rest.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed and authenticated
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- Your Telegram user ID (used for `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`)

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repo">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rigos0/superturtle.git
    cd superturtle
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Claude Code or Codex">
    ```bash
    claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
    # or
    codex --full-auto
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prompt">
    ```
    Set up Super Turtle for me.
    ```
    The agent walks you through everything. It will ask for your Telegram bot token, user ID, and optionally an OpenAI API key for voice transcription. Then it installs dependencies, writes config, and tells you how to start the bot.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Once setup is complete, start the Telegram bot with `cd super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot && bun run start`, then open Telegram and message your bot.

## BotFather Setup

Use [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) to create and configure your bot:

1. Run `/newbot` and finish the prompts.
2. Save the generated token as `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
3. Run `/setcommands` and paste:

```text
start - Show status and user ID
new - Start a fresh session
resume - Pick from recent sessions
context - Show context usage
stop - Interrupt current query
status - Check what Claude is doing
looplogs - Show bot logs
restart - Restart the bot
```

## Getting Your Telegram User ID

- Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) and copy your numeric ID.
- Or run `/start` in your bot chat and read the ID in the response.

## What the Setup Wizard Does

When you say "Set up Super Turtle for me", the agent runs `super_turtle/setup` which handles:

1. **Driver detection** — checks whether `claude` or `codex` is available on your PATH and selects the best default.
2. **Dependency install** — runs `bun install` in the bot directory to install all required packages.
3. **Environment file** — creates `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/.env` from the example template and fills in your Telegram token, user ID, working directory, and optional OpenAI key.
4. **Driver preferences** — writes `/tmp/claude-telegram-prefs.json` with the default model, effort level, and active driver.

The setup script accepts these flags if you want to run it manually:

```bash
./super_turtle/setup \
  --driver auto \
  --telegram-token "<token>" \
  --telegram-user "<id>" \
  --openai-api-key "<key>"      # optional
```

<Warning>
Do not commit `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/.env`. It contains your credentials and is local-only.
</Warning>
