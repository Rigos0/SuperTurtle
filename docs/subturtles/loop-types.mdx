# SubTurtle Loop Types

SubTurtles support four loop types:
- `slow`
- `yolo`
- `yolo-codex`
- `yolo-codex-spark`

Choose loop type based on complexity, iteration speed, and quota pressure.

## At a Glance

| Type | Calls per iteration | Runtime | Best for |
|------|---------------------|----------|----------|
| `slow` | 4 calls (Plan -> Groom -> Execute -> Review) | Claude + Codex | Complex, high-risk multi-file work |
| `yolo` | 1 call | Claude | Focused work that still benefits from Claude reasoning |
| `yolo-codex` | 1 call | Codex | Default mode for most coding tasks |
| `yolo-codex-spark` | 1 call | Codex Spark (`gpt-5.3-codex-spark`) | Fastest Codex iterations |

<Info>
`ctl spawn` and `ctl start` default to `--type yolo-codex`.
</Info>

## How Each Loop Executes

The loop dispatcher maps type to runtime function:

```python
LOOP_TYPES = {
    "slow": run_slow_loop,
    "yolo": run_yolo_loop,
    "yolo-codex": run_yolo_codex_loop,
    "yolo-codex-spark": run_yolo_codex_spark_loop,
}
```

### `slow` (Most Thorough)

`slow` runs a 4-phase loop each iteration:
1. Planner (Claude) creates one-commit plan.
2. Groomer (Claude) updates `CLAUDE.md` backlog/current marker.
3. Executor (Codex) implements the plan.
4. Reviewer (Claude) validates and adds follow-ups if needed.

Use `slow` when:
- The task is ambiguous or architecture-heavy.
- Multiple files/systems must stay consistent.
- You want explicit planning and review every cycle.

Tradeoff:
- Highest quality guardrails.
- Slowest and most expensive per iteration.

```bash
./super_turtle/subturtle/ctl spawn api-hardening --type slow --timeout 2h --state-file /tmp/api-hardening.md
```

### `yolo` (Fast Claude Loop)

`yolo` runs a single Claude call per iteration using the state-file protocol.

Use `yolo` when:
- Scope is clear.
- You still want Claude-centric reasoning.
- Codex quota is constrained.

Tradeoff:
- Faster than `slow`.
- Less structured guardrail than Plan/Groom/Review.

```bash
./super_turtle/subturtle/ctl spawn auth-fix --type yolo --timeout 1h --state-file /tmp/auth-fix.md
```

### `yolo-codex` (Default)

`yolo-codex` is the same single-call loop model as `yolo`, but uses Codex.

Use `yolo-codex` when:
- Work is implementation-heavy and well-scoped.
- You want best cost-efficiency for autonomous backlog progress.
- You are spawning many SubTurtles in parallel.

Tradeoff:
- Best default cost/speed balance.
- May require tighter state-file specificity than `slow`.

```bash
./super_turtle/subturtle/ctl spawn docs-agent --type yolo-codex --timeout 1h --state-file /tmp/docs-agent.md
```

### `yolo-codex-spark` (Fastest Iterations)

`yolo-codex-spark` uses the Codex runtime with model `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`.

Use `yolo-codex-spark` when:
- Latency matters more than deep reasoning.
- You want very rapid short iterations.
- Tasks are concrete and low-ambiguity.

Tradeoff:
- Fastest loop turnaround.
- Least conservative option for complex design decisions.

```bash
./super_turtle/subturtle/ctl spawn ui-polish --type yolo-codex-spark --timeout 45m --state-file /tmp/ui-polish.md
```

## Selection Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Default to yolo-codex">
    Start with `yolo-codex` for most tasks. It is the project default and best baseline for throughput.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Escalate to slow for complex work">
    If a task needs explicit planning/review or crosses many boundaries, switch to `slow`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use yolo when Claude reasoning is preferred">
    Pick `yolo` when you need Claude in a single-call loop (or Codex quota is high).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use yolo-codex-spark for shortest feedback loops">
    Pick Spark for highly concrete work where rapid iterations matter most.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Cost and Speed Tradeoffs

| Priority | Recommended type | Why |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| Maximum quality checks | `slow` | Includes planning and review each iteration |
| Balanced default | `yolo-codex` | Single-call loop + low-cost runtime |
| Claude-first single-call | `yolo` | Faster than `slow`, Claude reasoning |
| Maximum iteration speed | `yolo-codex-spark` | Spark model tuned for fast cycles |

## Operational Notes

- All loop types read `.subturtles/<name>/CLAUDE.md` as the source of truth.
- All loop types check for self-stop directive:

```md
## Loop Control
STOP
```

- Timeout/watchdog behavior is independent of loop type.
- Cron supervision behavior is independent of loop type.
