# Introduction

Super Turtle is an autonomous coding system you control from Telegram. You describe what you want built, and it handles decomposition, execution, and supervision on your machine.

You interact with one Meta Agent in chat. Behind the scenes, it can run work itself or spawn SubTurtles in parallel, route work between Claude Code and Codex, and report only meaningful milestones.
