# Meta Supervision

Meta supervision is the mechanism that keeps SubTurtles moving without constant user prompts.  
When the Meta Agent spawns a SubTurtle, it also schedules recurring cron check-ins that inspect progress and only notify on meaningful events.

Core behavior is defined in:

```text
super_turtle/meta/META_SHARED.md
```

Core implementation paths:

```text
super_turtle/subturtle/ctl
super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/cron.ts
super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/index.ts
super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/silent-notifications.ts
```

## How Supervision Is Registered

`ctl spawn` is the high-level entrypoint. It creates workspace state, starts the worker, and auto-registers a recurring cron job with `silent: true`.

```bash
./super_turtle/subturtle/ctl spawn docs-agent \
  --type yolo-codex \
  --timeout 1h \
  --state-file /tmp/docs-agent.md \
  --cron-interval 10m
```

The cron job prompt is pre-seeded to perform supervision actions:
- Run `ctl status <name>`
- Read `.subturtles/<name>/CLAUDE.md`
- Review `git log --oneline -10`
- Stay silent unless a notable event occurs

<Info>
Current `ctl` default supervision interval is `10m` (override with `--cron-interval` or `ctl reschedule-cron`).
</Info>

## Silent-First Supervision

Silent check-ins are designed to be invisible during normal progress.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Cron job wakes up">
    The bot checks due jobs every 10 seconds and executes the recurring SubTurtle job when `fire_at` is reached.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meta Agent performs supervision work">
    It runs the status/state/log checks and decides whether there is meaningful news.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Marker-gated forwarding">
    For silent jobs, Telegram receives output only if the response includes a notable marker (`🎉`, `⚠️`, `❌`, `🚀`, `🔔`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="No news means no message">
    If no marker is present, nothing is sent to the user.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The marker filter is implemented in `getSilentNotificationText(...)`:

```ts
const SILENT_NOTIFICATION_MARKERS = ["🎉", "⚠️", "⚠", "❌", "🚀", "🔔"] as const;
```

## Notification Triggers

Only these event classes should break silence:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="🎉 Finished">
    All backlog items are complete. Stop the SubTurtle, summarize what shipped, and state what starts next.
  </Card>
  <Card title="📍 Milestone">
    Significant progress checkpoint reached (for example major backlog completion or first working slice).
  </Card>
  <Card title="⚠️ Stuck">
    No meaningful movement across multiple check-ins, repeated retries, or clear off-track behavior.
  </Card>
  <Card title="❌ Error">
    Crash or hard failure blocking autonomous progress.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Optional notable update:
- `🔗 Preview` when a new `.tunnel-url` appears for frontend work.

## Notification Templates

Use concise, structured messages:

```text
🚀 Started: <name>
Working on: <task description>
Mode: <yolo-codex|yolo-codex-spark|yolo|slow> | Timeout: <duration>

🎉 Finished: <name>
✓ <item 1>
✓ <item 2>
✓ <item 3>
Next: <what starts next, or "Roadmap complete">

⚠️ Stuck: <name>
No progress for <N> check-ins.
Last activity: <description>
Action: <stop/restart/needs input>

❌ Error: <name>
<error description>
Action: <what meta agent did>

📍 Milestone: <name>
<N>/<total> backlog items complete.
Latest: <what just shipped>

🔗 Preview: <name>
<url>
```

## Progressing to the Next Task

When a SubTurtle finishes and the roadmap still has pending work:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stop completed worker">
    ```bash
    ./super_turtle/subturtle/ctl stop <name>
    ```
    This also removes that SubTurtle's recurring cron supervision job.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advance project state">
    Update root `CLAUDE.md`: mark completed items and move current focus to the next backlog item.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Seed next SubTurtle state">
    Write a fresh `.subturtles/&lt;name&gt;/CLAUDE.md` for the next focused chunk.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Spawn next run">
    Start a new `ctl spawn` run; supervision is auto-registered again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This is the autonomous conveyor belt model: spawn -> supervise silently -> notify on real news -> stop -> advance state -> respawn until roadmap completion.

## Failure Handling

If a cron execution itself fails, the bot sends a direct failure message and does not retry that fire:

```text
❌ Scheduled job failed (<job-id>).
<error summary>
```

This prevents hidden supervision failures while still avoiding noisy retries.
