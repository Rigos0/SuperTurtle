## Current Task
Write the full story in Markdown format at `books/vonnegut/slaughterhouse-five-threads.md`.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a complete short story (500-800 words) at `books/vonnegut/slaughterhouse-five-threads.md`. Vonnegut style: dark humor, non-linear time, fatalistic wit, "so it goes" refrain. The story follows a SubTurtle unstuck in time, experiencing its own creation, execution, and garbage collection simultaneously.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/vonnegut/` directory
- [ ] Write the full story in Markdown format <- current
- [ ] Add a brief author's note at the end
- [ ] Commit the finished story

## Loop Control Reminder
When all backlog items are done, append `## Loop Control\nSTOP` to this file.
