## Current Task
Write the full story in Markdown format at `books/poe2/the-raven-protocol.md`.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a complete short story (500-800 words) at `books/poe2/the-raven-protocol.md`. Poe style: gothic atmosphere, rhythmic prose bordering on verse, obsessive narrator, themes of loss and madness. The story follows a lone developer at midnight, haunted by a recurring error message that simply reads "Nevermore."

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/poe2/` directory
- [ ] Write the full story in Markdown format <- current
- [ ] Add a brief author's note at the end
- [ ] Commit the finished story

## Loop Control Reminder
