## Current Task
Write the full story in Markdown format.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a complete short story (500-800 words) at `books/bradbury/fahrenheit-401.md`. Bradbury style: lyrical prose, nostalgia, technology anxiety. The story takes place in a world where autonomous agents burn deprecated code — until one agent starts secretly preserving legacy functions.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/bradbury/` directory
- [ ] Write the full story in Markdown format <- current
- [ ] Add a brief author's note at the end
- [ ] Commit the finished story

## Loop Control Reminder
When all backlog items are done, append `## Loop Control\nSTOP` to this file.
