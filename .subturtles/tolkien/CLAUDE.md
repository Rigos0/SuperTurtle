## Current Task
Write chapter1.md for "The Shellmarillion" — the creation song in a Tolkien-style mythic register, ~500 words.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/tolkien/chapter1.md`. Tolkien-style: mythic, archaic language, grand scope. ~500 words. The Ainur sing the world into being, but it's all turtles.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/tolkien/` directory
- [ ] Write chapter1.md — the creation song (Ainur but turtles) <- current
- [ ] Ensure Tolkien voice (archaic, elevated, mythic register)
- [ ] Add a lineage or naming section
- [ ] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done
