## Current Task
Write Chapter 2 of "The Shellmarillion" — "The Kingdoms", about the turtle clans building shell-cities on the ocean floor.

## End Goal with Specs
A complete 3-chapter fantasy novella (~2000 words total) in Markdown format at `books/the-shellmarillion.md`. Each chapter 500-700 words. High fantasy tone — mythological creation story of the world's turtles, their ancient kingdoms, and the war against the Serpents of the Deep.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/` directory (if needed) and `books/the-shellmarillion.md` with title page
- [x] Write Chapter 1: "The Shaping" — the great turtle Chelónatar sings the ocean into existence
- [ ] Write Chapter 2: "The Kingdoms" — the turtle clans build shell-cities on the ocean floor <- current
- [ ] Write Chapter 3: "The Sundering" — the Serpents rise, the kingdoms fall, one turtle carries the memory forward
- [ ] Final read-through: ensure mythological consistency, add a map description in prose
- [ ] Commit the finished book

## Notes
Style: Tolkien's Silmarillion. Mythic register. Formal prose. Names matter.
