## Current Task
Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/tolkien/chapter1.md`. Tolkien-style: mythic, archaic language, grand scope. ~500 words. The Ainur sing the world into being, but it's all turtles.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/tolkien/` directory
- [x] Write chapter1.md — the creation song (Ainur but turtles)
- [x] Ensure Tolkien voice (archaic, elevated, mythic register)
- [x] Add a lineage or naming section
- [ ] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done <- current
