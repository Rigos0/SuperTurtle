## Current Task
All README reorder backlog items are complete.

## End Goal with Specs
`README.md` shows the selling propositions in this exact order near the top, with short text and easy scan flow:
1) uses your Claude Code or Codex subscription
2) mobile and voice control first
3) autonomous execution (tasks, sub-agents, webpage open/test, iteration)
4) runs on your machine (cloud deployment coming up)
5) tracks remaining usage and load-balances Claude Code/Codex
6) autonomous supervision via scheduled cron check-ins sending important updates

## Backlog
- [x] Read `docs/value-proposition.md` and treat it as source of truth.
- [x] Update README top section so first visible content after intro follows the 6-point order exactly.
- [x] Keep setup section minimal: clone repo first, then open Claude/Codex in repo root and say setup prompt.
- [x] Keep architecture concise (no giant ASCII diagram).
- [x] Commit with message: "README: align top narrative to canonical value proposition"

## Notes
- Edit only `README.md` unless a tiny supporting doc link is needed.
- Keep copy short and concrete.
- Preserve existing sticker style (big section stickers before major sections).
