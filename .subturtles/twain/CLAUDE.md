## Current Task
Write chapter1.md — "Turtleberry lights out for the river" in Twain voice.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/twain/chapter1.md`. Twain-style: folksy first-person vernacular, social satire, deadpan humor. ~500 words. A young turtle named Turtleberry escapes the Widow Douglas's pond to raft down the river with his friend Jim the snapping turtle.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/twain/` directory
- [ ] Write chapter1.md — Turtleberry lights out for the river <- current
- [ ] Ensure Twain voice (colloquial dialect, wry observations, social commentary)
- [ ] Include a humorous aside about "sivilization"
- [ ] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done
