## Current Task
Write Chapter 1 of "The Shell-Tale Heart" — a gothic horror tale narrated by a paranoid turtle. Create `books/poe/chapter1.md` and draft the narrator’s confession in the Poe voice with escalating paranoia and a climactic ending.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/poe/chapter1.md`. Poe-style: first-person unreliable narrator, escalating paranoia, gothic atmosphere. ~500 words. The narrator insists they are not mad — but the tapping of a shell beneath the floorboards says otherwise.

## Backlog
- [ ] Create `books/poe/` directory <- current
- [x] Create `books/poe/` directory
- [ ] Write chapter1.md — the narrator's fevered confession <- current
- [ ] Ensure Poe voice (frantic, repetitive, exclamatory, gothic)
- [ ] Build to a crescendo ending
- [ ] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done
