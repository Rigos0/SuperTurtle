## Current Task
Write Chapter 3: "The Confession" — the narrator tears up the sand screaming "it is the beating of his shell!"

## End Goal with Specs
A 3-chapter gothic horror novella (~2000 words) at `books/the-tell-tale-shell.md`. Poe-esque — unreliable narrator, mounting paranoia, rhythmic prose building to madness.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/the-tell-tale-shell.md` with title page
- [x] Write Chapter 1: "The Burial" — the narrator buries a rival's broken shell on the beach
- [x] Write Chapter 2: "The Sound" — a tapping begins, faint at first, then inescapable
- [ ] Write Chapter 3: "The Confession" — the narrator tears up the sand screaming "it is the beating of his shell!" <- current
- [ ] Final polish and commit
