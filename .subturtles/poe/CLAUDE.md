## Current Task
Ensure Poe voice matches the chapter: frantic, repetitive, exclamatory, and gothic

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/poe/chapter1.md`. Poe-style: first-person unreliable narrator, escalating paranoia, gothic atmosphere. ~500 words. The narrator insists they are not mad — but the tapping of a shell beneath the floorboards says otherwise.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/poe/` directory
- [x] Create `books/poe/` directory
- [x] Write chapter1.md — the narrator's fevered confession
- [ ] Ensure Poe voice (frantic, repetitive, exclamatory, gothic) <- current
- [x] Build to a crescendo ending
- [x] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done
