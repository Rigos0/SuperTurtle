## Current Task
All Poe chapter tasks are complete; add loop stop marker in this task file.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/poe/chapter1.md`. Poe-style: first-person unreliable narrator, escalating paranoia, gothic atmosphere. ~500 words. The narrator insists they are not mad — but the tapping of a shell beneath the floorboards says otherwise.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/poe/` directory
- [x] Create `books/poe/` directory
- [x] Write chapter1.md — the narrator's fevered confession
- [x] Ensure Poe voice (frantic, repetitive, exclamatory, gothic)
- [x] Build to a crescendo ending
- [x] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done

## Loop Control
STOP
