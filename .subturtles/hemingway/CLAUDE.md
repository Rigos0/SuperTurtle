## Current Task
Write the opening scene for Chapter 1 of "The Old Turtle and the Sea" — a tale of a stubborn turtle crossing the Pacific, in `books/hemingway/chapter1.md`.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/hemingway/chapter1.md`. Hemingway-style: terse, muscular prose, short sentences, deep subtext. ~500 words. About an old turtle who sets out across the ocean one last time.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/hemingway/` directory
- [ ] Write chapter1.md — opening scene (the turtle leaves the reef) <- current
- [ ] Review prose for Hemingway voice (short sentences, no adjectives)
- [ ] Add a one-line epilogue
- [ ] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done
