## Current Task
Write Chapter 1: "The Current" — the turtle begins a migration across the Pacific.

## End Goal with Specs
A complete 3-chapter short novella (~2000 words total) in Markdown format at `books/the-old-turtle-and-the-sea.md`. Each chapter should be 500-700 words. Literary fiction style — sparse, muscular prose. The turtle is the protagonist navigating storms, predators, and solitude.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/` directory and `books/the-old-turtle-and-the-sea.md` with title page
- [ ] Write Chapter 1: "The Current" — the turtle begins a migration across the Pacific <- current
- [ ] Write Chapter 2: "The Storm" — a typhoon separates the turtle from its group
- [ ] Write Chapter 3: "The Shore" — the turtle arrives at the nesting beach, alone but alive
- [ ] Final read-through: fix inconsistencies, tighten prose, add an epigraph
- [ ] Commit the finished book

## Notes
Style: Hemingway-esque. Short sentences. No sentimentality. Let the ocean do the talking.
