## Current Task
Add a one-line epilogue to `books/hemingway/chapter1.md`.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/hemingway/chapter1.md`. Hemingway-style: terse, muscular prose, short sentences, deep subtext. ~500 words. About an old turtle who sets out across the ocean one last time.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/hemingway/` directory
- [x] Write chapter1.md — opening scene (the turtle leaves the reef)
- [x] Review prose for Hemingway voice (short sentences, no adjectives) <- current
- [ ] Add a one-line epilogue
- [ ] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done
