## Current Task
Write chapter1.md — the dame walks into Shellowe's office.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/chandler/chapter1.md`. Chandler-style: hardboiled noir, cynical first-person, vivid similes, LA atmosphere. ~500 words. Philip Shellowe, private eye, sits in his office when a dame walks in — a sea turtle with legs that go all the way down.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/chandler/` directory
- [ ] Write chapter1.md — the dame walks into Shellowe's office <- current
- [ ] Ensure Chandler voice (cynical similes, staccato rhythm, world-weary narrator)
- [ ] Include at least three memorable hardboiled similes
- [ ] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done
