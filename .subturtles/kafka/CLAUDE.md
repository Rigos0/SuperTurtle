## Current Task
Write Chapter 3: "The Verdict" — the application is denied; the turtle learns to live exposed.

## End Goal with Specs
A 3-chapter surrealist novella (~2000 words) at `books/the-metamorphosis-of-shells.md`. Kafkaesque tone — bureaucratic absurdity, existential dread, dry humor.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/the-metamorphosis-of-shells.md` with title page
- [x] Write Chapter 1: "The Discovery" — the turtle wakes up shell-less
- [x] Write Chapter 2: "The Bureau" — it must apply to the Shell Reclamation Office for a replacement
- [ ] Write Chapter 3: "The Verdict" — the application is denied; the turtle learns to live exposed <- current
- [ ] Final polish and commit
