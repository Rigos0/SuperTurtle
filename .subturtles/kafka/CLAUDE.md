## Current Task
Write the full story in Markdown format.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a complete short story (500-800 words) at `books/kafka/the-metamorphosis-of-code.md`. Kafka style: surreal bureaucratic dread, alienation, absurdist transformation. The story follows a developer who wakes up one morning to find they have been transformed into a SubTurtle process.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/kafka/` directory
- [ ] Write the full story in Markdown format <- current
- [ ] Add a brief author's note at the end
- [ ] Commit the finished story

## Loop Control Reminder
When all backlog items are done, append `## Loop Control\nSTOP` to this file.
