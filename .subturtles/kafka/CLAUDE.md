## Current Task
Write chapter1.md for "The Metamorphosis of Shell" — Gregor discovers his transformation.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/kafka/chapter1.md`. Kafka-style: matter-of-fact surrealism, bureaucratic dread, alienation. ~500 words. A turtle named Gregor wakes one morning to find himself transformed into a monstrous human being. His family of turtles is horrified.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/kafka/` directory
- [ ] Write chapter1.md — Gregor discovers his transformation <- current
- [ ] Ensure Kafka voice (flat affect, surreal premises treated as mundane problems)
- [ ] End on a note of quiet dread
- [ ] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done
