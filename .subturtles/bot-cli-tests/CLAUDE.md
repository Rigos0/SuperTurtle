## Current Task
All backlog items complete.

## End Goal with Specs
Tests cover:
- CLI status parsing output handling (running/stopped, time left)
- CLI safety validations (invalid names, missing state file)
- CLI commands for spawn/start/stop list behavior using mocks

## Backlog
- [x] Review `super_turtle/subturtle/ctl` and related parsing helpers
- [x] Add/extend tests in `super_turtle/subturtle/tests/` for status/list/stop
- [x] Mock shell calls for deterministic output
- [x] Run targeted tests
- [x] Commit

## Notes
Focus on CLI behavior only. Keep commits small and frequent.

## Loop Control
STOP
