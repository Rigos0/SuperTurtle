## Current Task
All backlog items completed.

## End Goal with Specs
All current uncommitted changes are reviewed, grouped sensibly, and committed with clear messages. No unrelated edits are introduced. If there are no changes, report that and stop.

## Backlog
- [x] Run `git status -sb` and summarize what is modified/untracked
- [x] Review diffs to understand intent and scope
- [x] Group changes into logical commits (1..N) with clear messages
- [x] Ensure no accidental changes are included (clean up if needed)
- [x] Commit and confirm working tree is clean

## Notes
Focus on existing local changes only. Do not make new product changes. If changes look suspicious or incomplete, stop and report back in CLAUDE.md.
Committed group 1: Codex/driver routing parity fixes + tests; remaining groups still pending.

## Loop Control
STOP
