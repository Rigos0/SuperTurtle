## Current Task
Write chapter1.md — introduce the Shellnet family.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/austen/chapter1.md`. Austen-style: witty social commentary, ironic narrator, marriage plot. ~500 words. A truth universally acknowledged: a single turtle in possession of a good shell must be in want of a mate.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/austen/` directory
- [ ] Write chapter1.md — introduce the Shellnet family <- current
- [ ] Ensure Austen voice (ironic narrator, social wit, Regency diction)
- [ ] Include a memorable opening line
- [ ] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done
