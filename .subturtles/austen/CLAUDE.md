## Current Task
Austen subturtle backlog is complete; stop marker is present in this task file.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/austen/chapter1.md`. Austen-style: witty social commentary, ironic narrator, marriage plot. ~500 words. A truth universally acknowledged: a single turtle in possession of a good shell must be in want of a mate.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/austen/` directory
- [x] Write chapter1.md — introduce the Shellnet family
- [x] Ensure Austen voice (ironic narrator, social wit, Regency diction)
- [x] Include a memorable opening line
- [x] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done

## Loop Control
