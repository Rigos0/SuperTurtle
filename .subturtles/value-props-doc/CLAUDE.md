## Current Task
Backlog complete. No remaining items.

## End Goal with Specs
New file `docs/value-proposition.md` that defines the exact ordered list to drive README + landing copy.

Canonical ordered list:
1. SuperTurtle uses your Claude Code or Codex subscription.
2. Mobile and voice control first: run everything from Telegram by text or voice.
3. Autonomous execution: breaks work into tasks, runs sub-agents, can open/test webpages, and iterates until done.
4. Runs on your machine (cloud deployment coming up).
5. It tracks remaining usage and load-balances between Claude Code and Codex.
6. Autonomous supervision: scheduled cron check-ins monitor progress in the background and send important updates.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `docs/value-proposition.md` with the exact ordered list above.
- [x] Add a short section "Copy rules" with: keep copy short, keep order fixed, no extra claims.
- [x] Add a short section "Placement priority" that says first 3 points must appear above the fold on landing and near top of README.
- [x] Verify wording matches exactly (especially points 3 and 6).
- [x] Commit with message: "docs: add canonical value proposition order"

## Notes
- Keep this task docs-only. Do not edit README or landing files.
- Keep file concise (<=120 lines).
