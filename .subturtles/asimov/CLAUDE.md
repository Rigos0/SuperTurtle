## Current Task
Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done in `.subturtles/asimov/CLAUDE.md`.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/asimov/chapter1.md`. Asimov-style: clean expository prose, ideas-driven, exploring the Three Laws of Turtle-otics. ~500 words. A turtle gains consciousness inside a robotics lab.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/asimov/` directory
- [x] Write chapter1.md — the turtle wakes up in the lab
- [x] Ensure Asimov voice (logical, idea-focused, conversational)
- [x] Add a twist ending hint
- [ ] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done <- current
