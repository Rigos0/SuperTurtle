## Current Task
Write Chapter 1: "First Signal" — scientists detect an impossible signal from a turtle shell fossil.

## End Goal with Specs
A complete 3-chapter sci-fi novella (~2000 words total) in Markdown format at `books/shell-protocol.md`. Each chapter 500-700 words. Hard sci-fi tone — the turtles are an ancient species that evolved electromagnetic shell resonance into a faster-than-light communication network.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/` directory (if needed) and `books/shell-protocol.md` with title page
- [ ] Write Chapter 1: "First Signal" — scientists detect an impossible signal from a turtle shell fossil <- current
- [ ] Write Chapter 2: "The Network" — they discover living turtles are nodes in a galactic mesh network
- [ ] Write Chapter 3: "Contact" — humanity's first real-time conversation with an alien intelligence, mediated by turtles
- [ ] Final read-through: ensure sci-fi consistency, add a dedication page
- [ ] Commit the finished book

## Notes
Style: Asimov meets Carl Sagan. Sense of wonder. Grounded science extrapolated into the fantastic.
