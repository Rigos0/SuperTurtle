## Current Task
Write the full story in Markdown format.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a complete short story (500-800 words) at `books/lovecraft/the-call-of-cthulu-md.md`. Lovecraft style: cosmic horror, unreliable narrator, creeping dread, archaic vocabulary. The story follows a researcher who discovers an ancient Markdown file in a forgotten repository — a file that seems to rewrite itself and drive anyone who reads it to madness.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/lovecraft/` directory
- [ ] Write the full story in Markdown format <- current
- [ ] Add a brief author's note at the end
- [ ] Commit the finished story

## Loop Control Reminder
When all backlog items are done, append `## Loop Control\nSTOP` to this file.
