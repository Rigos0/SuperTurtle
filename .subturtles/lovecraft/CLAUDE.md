## Current Task
Write Chapter 2 of "The Shell Beyond the Stars" — they find carved shell fragments older than the Earth.

## End Goal with Specs
A 3-chapter cosmic horror novella (~2000 words) at `books/the-shell-beyond-the-stars.md`. Lovecraftian — purple prose, unknowable dread, a narrator driven mad by what they found.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/the-shell-beyond-the-stars.md` with title page
- [x] Write Chapter 1: "The Expedition" — marine biologists detect impossible sonar returns from the trench
- [ ] Write Chapter 2: "The Descent" — they find carved shell fragments older than the Earth <- current
- [ ] Write Chapter 3: "The Awakening" — Cthulhu was a turtle all along
- [ ] Final polish and commit
