## Current Task
Write chapter1.md — the librarian's discovery.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a short story file at `books/borges/chapter1.md`. Borges-style: philosophical fiction, labyrinthine logic, infinite recursion, erudite narrator. ~500 words. A librarian discovers that every possible arrangement of shell patterns corresponds to a book in the infinite library. Most are gibberish. One describes him perfectly.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/borges/` directory
- [ ] Write chapter1.md — the librarian's discovery <- current
- [ ] Ensure Borges voice (philosophical, recursive, paradoxical, scholarly footnotes)
- [ ] Include a mind-bending paradox about self-reference
- [ ] Write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` when done
