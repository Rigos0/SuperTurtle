## Current Task
Write Chapter 2: "The Commandments" — the new turtle council rewrites the reef's laws

## End Goal with Specs
A 3-chapter political satire (~2000 words) at `books/animal-reef.md`. Orwellian — power corrupts, commandments get rewritten, "All sea creatures are equal, but some shells are more equal than others."

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/animal-reef.md` with title page
- [x] Write Chapter 1: "The Revolution" — turtles rally against dolphin rule
- [ ] Write Chapter 2: "The Commandments" — the new turtle council rewrites the reef's laws <- current
- [ ] Write Chapter 3: "The Banquet" — turtles and dolphins become indistinguishable
- [ ] Final polish and commit
