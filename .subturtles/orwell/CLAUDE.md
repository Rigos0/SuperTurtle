## Current Task
Write the full story in Markdown format.

## End Goal with Specs
Create a complete short story (500-800 words) at `books/orwell/nineteen-eighty-fork.md`. Orwell style: stark political allegory, surveillance themes, controlled language. The story depicts a dystopian repository where Big Merge watches every commit and thought-diffs are forbidden.

## Backlog
- [x] Create `books/orwell/` directory
- [ ] Write the full story in Markdown format <- current
- [ ] Add a brief author's note at the end
- [ ] Commit the finished story

## Loop Control Reminder
When all backlog items are done, append `## Loop Control\nSTOP` to this file.
