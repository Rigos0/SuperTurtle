## Current Task
Write completion note and self-stop in the Codex SubTurtle test state file.

## End Goal with Specs
SubTurtle starts, runs a trivial check (e.g., list repo root), writes completion, and stops.

## Roadmap (Completed)
- None

## Roadmap (Upcoming)
- Spawn and verify Codex SubTurtle lifecycle

## Backlog
- [x] Verify repo root contents with a simple command
- [ ] Write completion note and self-stop
- [ ] Commit (skip if no code changes)

Verification:
- `ls -la` on repo root completed successfully and returned expected workspace files and directories.
