# UX Fundamentals

## What Super Turtle is

An autonomous coding system you talk to on Telegram. You describe what you want built — the system decomposes it, spawns workers, supervises them, and delivers results. You interact with a single conversational agent (the Meta Turtle) who handles everything behind the scenes.

## Core experience principle

**Say what → get results.** The user never thinks about processes, infrastructure, or agent orchestration. They say "build me X" and the system figures out how. The chat shows milestones, not machinery.

## First-run setup for new installs (Claude Code / Codex)

When this repo is opened for the first time in Claude Code or Codex, run setup as a guided wizard:

1. Confirm the user already has:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` from BotFather
   - `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` (their Telegram user ID)
   - Optional `OPENAI_API_KEY` for voice transcription
2. Run:
   - `./super_turtle/setup --driver auto --telegram-token "<token>" --telegram-user "<id>"`
   - Add `--openai-api-key "<key>"` only if provided
3. Explain what was configured (`.env`, dependencies, default driver) and ask the user to start the bot.

The goal is minimal manual setup: users provide keys/IDs, the agent does everything else.

## What the user sees

| Event | User sees | User doesn't see |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Work starts | "🚀 On it." | SubTurtle spawning, CLAUDE.md creation, cron registration |
| Work in progress | Nothing (silence = good) | Cron check-ins, status polling, git log inspection |
| Milestone reached | "🎉 Feature X is done. Starting Y next." | SubTurtle stop/restart, state file updates |
| Something broke | "⚠️ Hit a snag with X. Here's what happened: ..." | Log tailing, error diagnosis, restart attempts |
| Everything done | "✅ All done. Here's what shipped: ..." | Cron cleanup, watchdog termination |
| Preview available | "🔗 Preview: https://..." | Tunnel setup, port management |

## What the user never has to do

- Break down tasks into subtasks (the system decomposes)
- Choose which loop type to use (the system defaults to cheapest: yolo-codex)
- Monitor progress (the system checks silently and only reports news)
- Restart stuck workers (the system detects and recovers)
- Manage quotas (the system checks usage and routes work to the cheapest resource)

## Interaction model

1. **User sends a message** → Meta agent responds conversationally. If it's a coding task, spawns SubTurtles and confirms briefly.
2. **Silence** → Work is happening. No news is good news.
3. **Notification arrives** → Something meaningful happened. Read it — it's worth your attention.
4. **User asks "how's it going?"** → Meta agent checks and gives a plain-English summary.
5. **User says "stop"** → Work stops. No questions asked.

## Emotional design

- **Feels like a competent teammate**, not a CI pipeline
- **Respects attention** — never sends a message that wastes the user's time
- **Confident but honest** — says "I'm on it" when starting, "I'm stuck" when blocked
- **Celebrates wins** — completion messages feel like progress, not bureaucracy
- **Invisible when working** — the best UX is no UX during execution

## Resource management

- **Default to yolo-codex** — Codex is cheap and plentiful. Use it for everything unless the task needs Claude's reasoning.
- **Claude Code is precious** — every meta agent interaction, every cron check-in costs Claude Code quota. Minimize waste.
- **Auto-adjust** — when Claude Code is >80%, space out check-ins, shorten responses, force Codex for SubTurtles.
- **The user shouldn't think about quotas** — the system manages resources silently.

# Current task

Parallel system hardening and UX improvements:
- Telegram security review
- Cloudflare tunnel security review
- `/sub` command UX + parity (aliases, backlog-focused output)
- Codex meta-agent “stops until prompted” investigation
- Peekaboo-based screenshot tooling
- Long-run tracking + handoff state

# End goal with specs

Super Turtle repository — autonomous agent coordination system (SubTurtles). Core infrastructure is complete. Now improving the UX to make the system more autonomous and less noisy.

**Core infrastructure (done):**
- SubTurtle control (`ctl` command) — spawn, stop, monitor with timeouts
- State management — CLAUDE.md per agent, symlinked AGENTS.md
- Cron supervision — scheduled check-ins to monitor progress
- Loop types — slow (Plan→Groom→Execute→Review), yolo (single Claude call), yolo-codex (cost-optimized)
- Skills system — agents can load Claude Code skills on demand
- Tunnel support — cloudflared integration for frontend preview links
- SubTurtle self-stop — agents write `## Loop Control\nSTOP` to exit cleanly
- Silent check-ins — cron supervision runs silently, only messages user on news

**UX overhaul goal:** The user says "build X" and the system handles everything — decomposition, parallel SubTurtles, supervision, progression — with minimal noise. Chat shows progress milestones, not process spam.

# Roadmap (Completed)

- ✓ Core SubTurtle loop (slow/yolo/yolo-codex types, watchdog, timeout)
- ✓ Control script (`ctl` start/stop/status/logs/list + spawn)
- ✓ Cron job scheduling (one-shot + recurring, auto-fire)
- ✓ Skills loader system (agents can --skill <name>)
- ✓ Tunnel support (start-tunnel.sh helper, .tunnel-url tracking)
- ✓ Snake game (complete with 10 levels, obstacles, visual escalation, neon UI)
- ✓ Meta agent (decision-making, delegation, supervision)
- ✓ SubTurtle self-stop (`## Loop Control\nSTOP` directive, _should_stop() check)
- ✓ UX overhaul proposal (docs/UX-overhaul-proposal.md)
- ✓ UX Phase 1: Silent check-ins (silent cron, marker-gated notifications, META_SHARED.md updated)
- ✓ Code quality audit (docs/code-quality-audit.md — 1 critical fixed, 4 medium fixed, 6 documented)
- ✓ UX Phase 2: Structured message templates (notification formats for all event types)
- ✓ UX Phase 3: Task decomposition (DECOMPOSITION_PROMPT.md + META_SHARED.md protocol)
- ✓ UX Phase 4: Pipeline speed (`ctl reschedule-cron` command for dynamic intervals)
- ✓ UX Phase 5: Enhanced `/status` command (SubTurtle info, git log, usage in one view)
- ✓ UX Phase 6: Usage-aware resource management (quota decision matrix in META_SHARED.md)
- ✓ Default loop type changed to yolo-codex
- ✓ Always route through driver abstraction (remove config toggle)
- ✓ Codex: inject current date/time at session start
- ✓ Fix scheduled turtle duplicates + ensure scheduled notice ordering

# Roadmap (Upcoming)

- Codex parity gap audit (Claude vs Codex flows)
- Implement missing Codex driver/session/command features
- Harden restart behavior to avoid unsafe self-termination during autonomous runs
- Cloud deployment option (E2B integration on `e2b` branch, needs stabilization)
- End-to-end parity testing and overnight supervision validation
- Update docs with parity completion status and residual limitations

# Backlog

- [ ] Telegram security review (leak/attack surface) + fixes
- [ ] Cloudflare tunnel security review + fixes
- [ ] `/sub` command: backlog-focused output, Codex/Claude parity (aliases done: /sub /subs /subturtle /subturtles /turtle /turtles)
- [ ] Codex meta-agent stop-until-prompt issue: root cause + fix
- [ ] Peekaboo screenshot tooling wired into frontend guidance
- [ ] Long-run tracking: runs.jsonl + handoff.md (done; verify smoke test)
- [ ] Memory handling for “remember this” (small, explainable, meta-only)
- [ ] Update landing page palette to Epify Puzlo red-forward brand direction and verify mobile/desktop contrast/accessibility
- [ ] Investigate iOS Telegram inline button disappearance (ask_user + command buttons)
- [ ] Build Codex-vs-Claude parity checklist from current code/tests
- [ ] Implement Codex parity fixes in driver/session/handlers
- [ ] Run integration pass (Codex mode + Claude mode) and verify no regressions
- [ ] Update docs with completion status and known gaps
