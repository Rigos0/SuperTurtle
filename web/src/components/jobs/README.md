# Job Components

Reusable job UI elements used by `MyJobsPage` and `JobDetailPage`.

- `MetaRow.tsx`: compact label/value rows for timestamps and IDs.
- `ProgressBar.tsx`: job progress indicator with clamped percent rendering.
- `StatusFilter.tsx`: toggle chips for job-status filtering in list view.
- `Pagination.tsx`: previous/next pager with page counter and offset normalization.
