## Chapter 1: The Burial

You think me timorous. You think, because I walk with care and listen before each step, that I am weak in the shell and soft in the mind. Yet mark me now: had I been weak, I should have fled when the moon rose white over the reef and the tide drew back like a sheet pulled from a corpse. Had I been weak, I should have left the broken thing where it fell.

But I did not flee. I did not leave it.

He had mocked me before them all, beneath the lantern-jellies, where the court of tide-worn stones meets each dusk. He struck his claw upon my carapace and named me Hollowback, and they laughed, not because he was witty, but because he was loud, and loudness has ever been mistaken for power by fools and minnows. He said my shell rang empty. He said the sea had forgotten to fill me.

Ah! If they had heard what I heard in him, they would have shrunk from his voice.

There was a crack in his shell. Small, yes. A pale seam near the heart-plate, thin as a worm's path in wet sand. None saw it save I, for none watched him as closely. He carried himself broad and bright, a captain among scavengers, but each time he laughed the seam twitched; each boast widened it by a breath. I watched and learned. I listened and waited.

Do you call this malice? It was justice, keen and patient.

That night the wind came down from the black dunes and rattled the dry reeds like bones. He followed me, as I knew he would, muttering threats half-drunk on fermented kelp, his shadow lurching over the flats. "Hollowback!" he called. "Turn and hear me!" I turned at last, where no reef-lamp shone and only the long red eye of Mars looked on. He came close, stinking of brine and rot, and raised his claw again as if my shell were his drum.

He struck once.

I struck once.

I shall not recount the blow. I am not coarse. Enough that when he fell, he fell without laughter. Enough that the pale seam split with a sound so slight, so delicate, that at first I thought it imagined: a small, dry *tik*, like a pebble touched by another pebble in the dark.

He lay still. The tide sighed in and out. Far off, some sleepless gull cried as if at a christening or a funeral; in that hour they are the same ceremony.

Then I saw it: a curved shard of shell, no larger than my thumb-claw, broken free from his breast-plate and shining dully in the moonlight. I took it up. Warm. Ridged. Innocent as a fragment of moon.

Why did I keep it? Why did I not cast it into the water at once? I ask myself, and I answer plainly: because the piece accused me. His whole body, broken and dumb, seemed less alive than that one bit of shell in my palm. It trembled there, or seemed to tremble. I felt a tapping in it, faint as a pulse heard through sand.

Nonsense, you say. So said I.

I dragged him above the flood-line where the dunes begin, to a hollow between two bent grasses. The sand was cold and damp below the crust, and my claws worked quickly, quickly, for dawn waits for no guilty creature. Again and again the surf hissed behind me, like a congregation whispering prayer while the priest digs. I widened the pit until it took him. I covered him. I smoothed the mound with care. I scattered wrack and broken reeds so no eye would linger there.

All this I did with a composure that should prove my sanity to any fair judge.

Yet the shard remained.

I could not bury that with him. Do not demand why. There are reasons finer than speech. It had become, by some strange right, my property and my burden both. I wrapped it in eelgrass and tucked it beneath my own chest-plate, against the inner curve where warmth collects.

As I walked home over the flats, each step gave a tiny answer from within me.

*Tik.*

I paused.

Nothing but wind.

I walked again.

*Tik... tik.*

It was the rubbing of the eelgrass, I told myself. The knocking of grit between my scales. The ordinary chatter of a sleepless shore.

By the time the first strip of morning opened along the horizon, I had repeated these explanations a hundred times and believed each one in turn.

I reached my chamber cut in the chalk bank and barred the driftwood door. I set the wrapped shard upon the table-stone. It lay still. Silent. Merely a curve of dead matter, drained of ownership, drained of voice. I laughed then, softly at first, then louder, until my own mirth sounded foreign to me.

I lit no lamp. I sat in the gray before dawn and watched that little bundle while the sea withdrew, returned, withdrew.

Toward sunrise, when the reef bells began their dim tolling for market tide, I bent my ear close and held my breath.

From within the eelgrass came a single patient sound.

*Tik.*
