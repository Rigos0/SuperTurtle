# The Tell-Tale Shell

## A Gothic Novella of Sand and Sound

*For those who have listened too long to the silence beneath the tide.*

## Chapter 1: The Burial

You think me timorous. You think, because I walk with care and listen before each step, that I am weak in the shell and soft in the mind. Yet mark me now: had I been weak, I should have fled when the moon rose white over the reef and the tide drew back like a sheet pulled from a corpse. Had I been weak, I should have left the broken thing where it fell.

But I did not flee. I did not leave it.

He had mocked me before them all, beneath the lantern-jellies, where the court of tide-worn stones meets each dusk. He struck his claw upon my carapace and named me Hollowback, and they laughed, not because he was witty, but because he was loud, and loudness has ever been mistaken for power by fools and minnows. He said my shell rang empty. He said the sea had forgotten to fill me.

Ah! If they had heard what I heard in him, they would have shrunk from his voice.

There was a crack in his shell. Small, yes. A pale seam near the heart-plate, thin as a worm's path in wet sand. None saw it save I, for none watched him as closely. He carried himself broad and bright, a captain among scavengers, but each time he laughed the seam twitched; each boast widened it by a breath. I watched and learned. I listened and waited.

Do you call this malice? It was justice, keen and patient.

That night the wind came down from the black dunes and rattled the dry reeds like bones. He followed me, as I knew he would, muttering threats half-drunk on fermented kelp, his shadow lurching over the flats. "Hollowback!" he called. "Turn and hear me!" I turned at last, where no reef-lamp shone and only the long red eye of Mars looked on. He came close, stinking of brine and rot, and raised his claw again as if my shell were his drum.

He struck once.

I struck once.

I shall not recount the blow. I am not coarse. Enough that when he fell, he fell without laughter. Enough that the pale seam split with a sound so slight, so delicate, that at first I thought it imagined: a small, dry *tik*, like a pebble touched by another pebble in the dark.

He lay still. The tide sighed in and out. Far off, some sleepless gull cried as if at a christening or a funeral; in that hour they are the same ceremony.

Then I saw it: a curved shard of shell, no larger than my thumb-claw, broken free from his breast-plate and shining dully in the moonlight. I took it up. Warm. Ridged. Innocent as a fragment of moon.

Why did I keep it? Why did I not cast it into the water at once? I ask myself, and I answer plainly: because the piece accused me. His whole body, broken and dumb, seemed less alive than that one bit of shell in my palm. It trembled there, or seemed to tremble. I felt a tapping in it, faint as a pulse heard through sand.

Nonsense, you say. So said I.

I dragged him above the flood-line where the dunes begin, to a hollow between two bent grasses. The sand was cold and damp below the crust, and my claws worked quickly, quickly, for dawn waits for no guilty creature. Again and again the surf hissed behind me, like a congregation whispering prayer while the priest digs. I widened the pit until it took him. I covered him. I smoothed the mound with care. I scattered wrack and broken reeds so no eye would linger there.

All this I did with a composure that should prove my sanity to any fair judge.

Yet the shard remained.

I could not bury that with him. Do not demand why. There are reasons finer than speech. It had become, by some strange right, my property and my burden both. I wrapped it in eelgrass and tucked it beneath my own chest-plate, against the inner curve where warmth collects.

As I walked home over the flats, each step gave a tiny answer from within me.

*Tik.*

I paused.

Nothing but wind.

I walked again.

*Tik... tik.*

It was the rubbing of the eelgrass, I told myself. The knocking of grit between my scales. The ordinary chatter of a sleepless shore.

By the time the first strip of morning opened along the horizon, I had repeated these explanations a hundred times and believed each one in turn.

I reached my chamber cut in the chalk bank and barred the driftwood door. I set the wrapped shard upon the table-stone. It lay still. Silent. Merely a curve of dead matter, drained of ownership, drained of voice. I laughed then, softly at first, then louder, until my own mirth sounded foreign to me.

I lit no lamp. I sat in the gray before dawn and watched that little bundle while the sea withdrew, returned, withdrew.

Toward sunrise, when the reef bells began their dim tolling for market tide, I bent my ear close and held my breath.

From within the eelgrass came a single patient sound.

*Tik.*

## Chapter 2: The Sound

Do not imagine that I surrendered at once to terror. I am no hatchling to start at each grain that falls from a dune. Morning came clear; the reef-market sang with barter and insults; the old limpet woman outside my bank-threshold quarreled with a knife-fish over spoiled kelp, and all the world proceeded in its customary vulgarity. I slept an hour, perhaps two, and woke persuaded that night's event had been an overstrung fancy, born of wind and toil and the sour fumes of fear.

To prove it so, I unwrapped the shard in full day.

It lay upon the table-stone dull and blameless, white as a fingernail clipping. I turned it over with the tip of my claw. I held it to the light. Nothing in its ridges suggested life; nothing in its curve suggested purpose. I set it down and laughed at myself with admirable reason.

Then, as my laughter thinned, I heard it.

*Tik.*

Not from the stone. Not from the door. From beneath the very laugh in my throat, as if another mouth had spoken inside my chest.

I sprang up and searched the chamber with an exactitude of which only a calm intellect is capable. I lifted the reed mat. I shook the kelp sacks. I peered beneath the sleeping ledge where crabs and old sorrows hide. I pressed my ear to the chalk wall and listened to seep-water trickling in secret veins. At last I discovered the culprit: a drop from the ceiling gathering, swelling, and falling into a shell-bowl by the hearth.

*Tik.*

You see? Explained! Resolved! I moved the bowl.

For a little while there was peace.

By dusk, however, when shadows from the dune-grasses had climbed my walls like bars, I heard it again. Fainter now, but regular, imperturbable.

*Tik... tik... tik.*

It came while I ate. It came while I washed. It came when I sat with my back to the wall and counted each breath until the counting itself turned slippery. I told myself it was the tide striking some hollow root outside. I told myself it was market noise carried oddly through stone. I told myself that guilt, which priests and widows praise so highly, had no jurisdiction over me, for I had performed an act of proportionate correction and no more.

Yet when I placed the shard in a wooden box and tied the box shut with eelcord, the sound grew clearer.

If you had been there, you would have heard it too.

By the second night I ceased to visit the market. Eyes annoyed me. Voices entered my skull and stirred the tapping into faster rhythm. I sat indoors and made experiments. I buried the shard beneath sand in a jar: *tik.* I wrapped it in wool-weed: *tik.* I sealed it in fish-wax and pressed the seal with my own signet-claw, laughing as judges laugh when fools petition them: *tik... tik... tik.*

The thing possessed no lungs, no blood, no tongue, and yet it persisted with the obstinacy of accusation.

Toward midnight, driven by reason alone, I carried it back to the dunes where he lay. The moon had not yet risen; the world was a blind throat of cloud. I found the mound by touch, my claws sinking into cold wet sand. I dug frantically, not to uncover him, no, but merely to place the shard with its source and have done. At last my claw struck something hard beneath the grit.

I recoiled.

It was only a stone.

Still the tapping quickened.

*Tik-tik. Tik-tik. Tik-tik.*

I thrust the wrapped piece deep into the hollow and smoothed the surface. Then I walked away without turning, because turning is for doubters and I had no doubt at all.

Before I reached the flats, the sound had returned, not behind me now but with me, within my pace, matching each step like a second set of feet.

Days passed, if days they were. Sleep became a rumor told by strangers. Whenever I drifted, that tapping entered my dreams and struck against my teeth. I saw his pale seam opening and closing like an eye. I heard the court-laughter from the lantern-jellies, stretched thin and metallic until each jeer was only the old syllable repeated: *tik, tik, tik.*

I took to speaking aloud, for conversation with oneself is the privilege of clear thinkers. "You are a fragment," I told the box. "You are calcium and memory and nothing further." I recited market prices, tide tables, genealogies of reef captains dead these forty seasons, all to demonstrate continuity of mind. Between each item came the answer.

*Tik.*

One evening the limpet woman knocked and called through my driftwood door, asking why I had not traded in three tides. I opened only a crack. Her eyes, pearl-filmed and merciless, peered past me toward the table where the box sat rocking ever so slightly, though no wind moved.

"You keeping a clock now, Hollowback?" she asked.

I struck the door shut with such force the hinges screamed.

A clock! Do you hear how the universe mocks? She spoke casually, yet the word entered me like a hook. Clock. Measure. Judgment. Each *tik* another grain fallen through an unseen neck of glass, counting down to what? To discovery? To damnation? To that moment when silence itself would split and spill the buried truth into daylight?

Tonight the tapping is louder than the surf. Louder than thought. It fills the chamber, the dunes, the whole black vault above the reef. I press my claws against my head until the joints burn, but still it comes, patient and triumphant.

*Tik.*

*Tik.*

*Tik.*
