## Chapter 1: The Discovery

K. opened his eyes to the usual pale light filtering through the study's window. For a moment—the briefest of moments—nothing was wrong. The floorboards creaked as they always did. The desk held the same stack of unfinished reports, their corners curling like old leaves. Even the smell was familiar: leather, dust, and the faint sourness of tea left too long in its cup.

It was only when he attempted to rise that he understood.

His body was wrong. Not sick, exactly. Wrong in a way that suggested he had never been right at all, that this was merely the first moment he had bothered to notice. He lay on his back, his limbs exposed to the air in a manner that seemed vulgar. More disturbingly, there was nothing above him. No curved dome. No protective architecture. Where his shell should have been—the shell that had always been there, that he had never even thought to question—there was now only the cold geometry of the ceiling.

K. lay motionless for some time, waiting for the sensation to resolve itself, the way a dream dissolves upon waking. It did not. He flexed what he could flex. Everything responded. The absence of his shell was not a paralysis but a nakedness, which was somehow worse.

He decided the matter required investigation.

The mirror in the bathroom offered terrible confirmation. His body was indeed complete—all four limbs, the small reptilian tail, the general configuration of himself intact. But he was exposed in the way a creature should never be exposed. The soft, pale skin that he vaguely remembered existing beneath the shell now constituted his entire exterior. He looked at himself the way one might look at something that had been turned inside out.

"This is impossible," he muttered, then stopped. The sound of his own voice frightened him. Without the shell's acoustics, it fell flat and somehow accusatory, as though he had spoken a blasphemy.

He could not go to work like this.

K. put on his suit with the methodical precision of a man performing a familiar rite in terrible circumstances. The fabric hung differently now, catching on his bare skin in ways he had never anticipated. As he dressed, he began to inventory the problem. The shell had been a constant for as long as he could remember—which, he realized, might not be as long as he ought to want. Had there been a before-shell? The question made his head ache.

By the time he reached the office, K. had constructed a hypothesis: perhaps nobody would notice. Perhaps this was a private transformation. Perhaps it was, in the grand scheme of things, a matter of paperwork, a form to fill out, a bureaucratic glitch that could be corrected with proper documentation. He had always believed that most problems, given sufficient regulation, might be adequately managed.

The moment he entered the building, he saw the secretary look up. Her expression did not change. She returned to her typing. Down the corridor, a colleague passed without comment. K. felt something crack inside him—not pain, but the sound of a small, necessary structure giving way.

By afternoon, he had begun to wonder if the shell had ever truly existed, or if he had merely been maintaining an elaborate fiction all these years. Perhaps everyone had always been bare like this. Perhaps the shell was not a thing that one lost but a thing that one had never had to begin with.

This thought did not comfort him.

At 4:47 p.m., just as he was reshelving a file from the morning's work, his supervisor appeared at his desk. Mr. Gritz was a man of unexceptional features and exceptional authority, the kind of supervisor who seemed not to live in the world but rather to administer it from some remove.

"K.," he said simply. "Your paperwork is incomplete."

K. looked at the stack before him. Every form was in order, every field filled. But of course Gritz did not mean the physical files.

"Which section?" K. asked, though he already knew the answer.

"The classification of your current status. Until it's submitted to Human Resources, the situation remains," Gritz paused, searching for a word that would not come, "irregular."

The word hung in the air like smoke, and K. understood that the shell was now a matter not of nature but of administration. This, somehow, made it worse. Had the shell been gone before, or was it only now, in the official moment of its acknowledgment, that the loss became real?

"I'll submit the forms tomorrow," K. said, but Gritz was already walking away.

He did not turn back.
