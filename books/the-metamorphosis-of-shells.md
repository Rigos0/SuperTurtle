## Chapter 1: The Discovery

K. opened his eyes to the usual pale light filtering through the study's window. For a moment—the briefest of moments—nothing was wrong. The floorboards creaked as they always did. The desk held the same stack of unfinished reports, their corners curling like old leaves. Even the smell was familiar: leather, dust, and the faint sourness of tea left too long in its cup.

It was only when he attempted to rise that he understood.

His body was wrong. Not sick, exactly. Wrong in a way that suggested he had never been right at all, that this was merely the first moment he had bothered to notice. He lay on his back, his limbs exposed to the air in a manner that seemed vulgar. More disturbingly, there was nothing above him. No curved dome. No protective architecture. Where his shell should have been—the shell that had always been there, that he had never even thought to question—there was now only the cold geometry of the ceiling.

K. lay motionless for some time, waiting for the sensation to resolve itself, the way a dream dissolves upon waking. It did not. He flexed what he could flex. Everything responded. The absence of his shell was not a paralysis but a nakedness, which was somehow worse.

He decided the matter required investigation.

The mirror in the bathroom offered terrible confirmation. His body was indeed complete—all four limbs, the small reptilian tail, the general configuration of himself intact. But he was exposed in the way a creature should never be exposed. The soft, pale skin that he vaguely remembered existing beneath the shell now constituted his entire exterior. He looked at himself the way one might look at something that had been turned inside out.

"This is impossible," he muttered, then stopped. The sound of his own voice frightened him. Without the shell's acoustics, it fell flat and somehow accusatory, as though he had spoken a blasphemy.

He could not go to work like this.

K. put on his suit with the methodical precision of a man performing a familiar rite in terrible circumstances. The fabric hung differently now, catching on his bare skin in ways he had never anticipated. As he dressed, he began to inventory the problem. The shell had been a constant for as long as he could remember—which, he realized, might not be as long as he ought to want. Had there been a before-shell? The question made his head ache.

By the time he reached the office, K. had constructed a hypothesis: perhaps nobody would notice. Perhaps this was a private transformation. Perhaps it was, in the grand scheme of things, a matter of paperwork, a form to fill out, a bureaucratic glitch that could be corrected with proper documentation. He had always believed that most problems, given sufficient regulation, might be adequately managed.

The moment he entered the building, he saw the secretary look up. Her expression did not change. She returned to her typing. Down the corridor, a colleague passed without comment. K. felt something crack inside him—not pain, but the sound of a small, necessary structure giving way.

By afternoon, he had begun to wonder if the shell had ever truly existed, or if he had merely been maintaining an elaborate fiction all these years. Perhaps everyone had always been bare like this. Perhaps the shell was not a thing that one lost but a thing that one had never had to begin with.

This thought did not comfort him.

At 4:47 p.m., just as he was reshelving a file from the morning's work, his supervisor appeared at his desk. Mr. Gritz was a man of unexceptional features and exceptional authority, the kind of supervisor who seemed not to live in the world but rather to administer it from some remove.

"K.," he said simply. "Your paperwork is incomplete."

K. looked at the stack before him. Every form was in order, every field filled. But of course Gritz did not mean the physical files.

"Which section?" K. asked, though he already knew the answer.

"The classification of your current status. Until it's submitted to Human Resources, the situation remains," Gritz paused, searching for a word that would not come, "irregular."

The word hung in the air like smoke, and K. understood that the shell was now a matter not of nature but of administration. This, somehow, made it worse. Had the shell been gone before, or was it only now, in the official moment of its acknowledgment, that the loss became real?

"I'll submit the forms tomorrow," K. said, but Gritz was already walking away.

He did not turn back.

## Chapter 2: The Bureau

The Shell Reclamation Office occupied the fourteenth floor of a building that seemed, upon closer inspection, to have no thirteenth floor whatsoever. K. discovered this while waiting in the elevator, studying the illuminated buttons with the same intensity he might have brought to a work of philosophy. The absence was present, somehow. An intentional gap. He found this oddly comforting—at least the bureaucracy was honest about what it refused to acknowledge.

The office itself was a maze of pale corridors, each one indistinguishable from the last. The lighting was designed neither for comfort nor for efficiency, but for some third purpose that K. could not quite name. Exposure, perhaps. Visibility. The kind of light that made one aware of one's own inadequacy without providing sufficient clarity to address it.

At the front desk sat a woman of indeterminate age, her hair pinned back with the severity of someone who had fought a long war against entropy. She did not look up as K. approached.

"I need to file a claim," K. said. "For a shell. I seem to have lost mine."

The woman continued typing. The sound of the keys filled the space between them like a conversation. Finally, without turning her head, she extended a form.

"Form 427-B," she said, her voice the color of grey concrete. "Submit it to the assessment window. Third door on your left. You will need form 428-C as well."

"But I only—"

"Form 428-C," she repeated, still not looking at him, and handed him a second sheet. "It's required for subsection verification."

K. took both forms and moved toward the indicated door. The other applicants in the waiting area seemed carved from the same material as the walls. A man with a peculiar hunched posture sat reading a pamphlet titled "Your Rights in Shell Reclamation Proceedings (Abridged)." A woman with yellowed fingernails filled out a form in pencil, stopping every few seconds to erase something with such violent precision that K. wondered if she might tear the paper entirely.

The assessment window revealed a official of indifferent features behind a pane of scuffed plexiglass.

"I'm here to file a claim," K. began.

The official glanced at him without apparent interest. "You have the forms?"

"Yes. 427-B and 428-C."

"They are filled out?"

K. looked down. He held blank forms in his hands.

"No," he admitted.

The official reached beneath the counter and produced a pen. It was a cheap pen, the kind that barely functioned, the kind designed to make writing an act of frustration. "You may fill them out in the waiting area. When you are finished, return them here. Do not lose your queue number."

A small slip of paper emerged from a slot. The number was 487.

The waiting area had changed. Now it held perhaps twenty people, all of them in various states of filling out forms. K. found a plastic chair that seemed specifically designed to encourage anxiety and began his paperwork.

Form 427-B was straightforward enough: name, address, species, date of shell loss. But form 428-C was another matter entirely. It asked for the "original provenance documentation" of his shell. When was it acquired? From what provider? Were there witnesses? What was its condition at the time of disappearance?

K. had never owned his shell. It had always been there, the way the sky was there. The form seemed to require him to prove something he had never thought to document.

He turned to the woman next to him, the one with the yellowed fingers.

"Excuse me," he said quietly. "How do you prove provenance for something you've always had?"

She smiled. It was a terrible smile. "You don't. You fill it out anyway."

When his number was called—three hours later—K. returned to the window with his completed forms. The official reviewed them with the care one might bring to examining a meal that might be poisoned.

"This section," the official said, pointing to K.'s explanation of why he had no shell acquisition documents, "is insufficient."

"What more can I provide? I've never had documentation. The shell was simply—" K. searched for the words. "—inherent."

The official looked at him as though this statement was not merely unhelpful but actively offensive to the entire concept of bureaucracy. "You will need to fill out form 432-D. It's a declaration of inherent status. Submit it to the verification committee on the twelfth floor."

"The twelfth floor?" K. asked. "I thought we were on the fourteenth."

The official's expression did not change. "Correct."

K. left the window with form 432-D, a new queue number, and the distinct sense that he had moved not closer to his shell but further from understanding what had been lost.

The twelfth floor smelled of old paper and something vaguely medicinal. A sign directed him to an office at the corridor's end, where a man with remarkably small eyes reviewed documents through the lens of profound skepticism. This official—his nameplate read "Vermuth"—informed K. that form 432-D required signature verification from two references who could attest to his previous possession of a shell.

"But who would know?" K. asked. "Everyone simply assumes—"

"Then they should sign the form," Vermuth said. "Otherwise, how can I verify?"

By evening, K. had collected the signatures—his mother's, with trembling hands, and that of a colleague from the office who understood, without being told, the gravity of the bureaucratic moment. He brought them back to Vermuth.

The official examined each signature with a jeweler's loupe. "These will be processed," he said finally. "Return in one week for the committee's assessment."

"And then?" K. asked.

Vermuth looked up, as though the question itself was naive. "And then, perhaps, you will be assigned a hearing."
