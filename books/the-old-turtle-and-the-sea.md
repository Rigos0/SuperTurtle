## Chapter 1: The Current

The turtle knew when it was time to leave. He had lived eighty-three years, and the knowledge came to him as it always did—not in thought, but in the turning of the water, the shift of the light, the call of something ancient and necessary in his blood.

He pushed away from the shallows where he had nested that year. The sand fell from his shell. Behind him, the other turtles were already moving, shadows slipping through the warm water toward the open sea. He did not watch them go. He swam.

The current caught him quickly. It was strong and steady, pulling him northeast as his flippers beat against the weight of the ocean. Around him, the water deepened from clear blue to a darker shade, and the bottom disappeared. This was how it was. The reef gave way to nothing, and you swam into it anyway.

For three days, he saw nothing but water. The surface was calm, the kind of calm that meant the weather was thinking about changing. The sun burned above. He dove deep to find cooler layers, where the pressure settled against his shell like an old hand. At night, the stars were so bright they nearly hurt. He did not understand this, but he had learned not to question it.

The hunger came early. A school of fish scattered past, and he caught one—two, quick movements of his mouth. They were small and thin, and he would need more, but they kept him moving. Moving was what mattered. The current would not wait for hunger to pass.

On the fourth day, the water changed. It became rougher, choppy, the sky above it growing gray at the edges. The turtle had seen storms before. He dove again, deeper this time, where the water was cold and dark and still. He waited. This was patience. This was survival.

When he emerged, the wind was driving the waves into white-capped walls. He swam through them without fighting, letting the power of the ocean push him where it would. Fighting the sea was a young turtle's mistake. The old ones knew better. You moved with it, you used what it gave you, and you kept moving.

There was a pain in his left rear flipper. Something had caught him near the reef as he left—a piece of coral, perhaps, or a hook from the nets that hung near the shallows where men came. He did not think about it. Pain was information, nothing more. It meant he was still alive. It meant the flipper still worked.

The sun set. The stars came. The turtle swam.

He did not know how far the journey was. It would take months. His destination was a place he had never been but had always known—a beach on an island somewhere across the vast, terrible empty of the Pacific. Other turtles would go there too. He would not think about them now. What mattered was the next stroke of his flippers, the next breath of air, the next moment of forward movement.

The ocean was everything. It was hunger and cold and distance. It was the only thing that had ever made sense.

He swam into the darkness.

## Chapter 2: The Storm

The typhoon did not announce itself. There was only a change in the texture of the air, a thickening, a smell like copper in the water. The turtle felt it through his shell before he saw it—a pressure dropping, the ocean beginning to boil with something that was not hunger or hunger or heat, but rage.

The wind came from the northeast. It drove the waves into mountains that had no shape, no pattern. The turtle had swum through storms before, but this was different. This was the ocean's refusal. This was death sorting through possibilities.

He tried to dive, to find the cold, still water below. But the current was too strong, pulling him down and sideways at once, tumbling him through layers of turbulent water. His old flippers fought for control. He had been strong once. He was still strong, but strength was not enough for this. Nothing was enough for this.

When he surfaced, the rain was so thick he could not see the horizon. There was only the next wave, and the next, and the next. They towered above him and crashed down, pushing him under, spinning him, driving the salt-water deep into his lungs until he was not sure which way was up. He had heard of drowning. He had not known what it felt like until now.

There were other turtles nearby. He had seen them in the dark water before the storm—three or four, maybe more, swimming in the same current, moving toward the same destination. Now they were gone. He had called out, if turtles could call. He had not expected an answer. But the absence of the others was a weight he had not known he was carrying.

A log struck him—or a piece of something, something large and dense that the storm had pulled from somewhere beyond the horizon and thrown into his path. The impact drove the air from his lungs. He felt a crack in his shell, new pain, sharp and immediate. His left rear flipper—the one that had been hurt near the reef—was not working properly now. It dangled, useless. He would have to move with three limbs now. He had moved with less once, in a younger life. But he was not young anymore.

The storm had no mercy and no end. It lasted days, or hours that felt like days. Time was not a thing that existed in it. There was only the next breath, the next desperate movement, the next moment of not dying.

On the third day—or the fifth, he could not be certain—the rain stopped. The wind did not stop, but the rain stopped, and that was something. The waves were still large, still angry, but they were beginning to have shape again, pattern, direction. The turtle could move against them now. He could choose his direction instead of simply accepting the ocean's direction.

He was alone. When he dove deep and looked around, there was nothing but water and distance. The other turtles were gone. He did not know if they were dead or scattered, carried away by currents that did not follow the same rules as the one he was on. He did not spend much time thinking about it.

His shell ached. His flipper did not work. The hunger was back, heavier now, complicated by exhaustion. But he was alive, and the current was still pulling him northeast, toward the island, toward the beach where the knowledge in his blood told him he needed to be.

He did not know how long it would take now. Months, still, probably. Months of moving with three working flippers. Months of hunger and pain and solitude.

He swam forward anyway. There was nothing else to do.
