## Chapter 1: The Current

The turtle knew when it was time to leave. He had lived eighty-three years, and the knowledge came to him as it always did—not in thought, but in the turning of the water, the shift of the light, the call of something ancient and necessary in his blood.

He pushed away from the shallows where he had nested that year. The sand fell from his shell. Behind him, the other turtles were already moving, shadows slipping through the warm water toward the open sea. He did not watch them go. He swam.

The current caught him quickly. It was strong and steady, pulling him northeast as his flippers beat against the weight of the ocean. Around him, the water deepened from clear blue to a darker shade, and the bottom disappeared. This was how it was. The reef gave way to nothing, and you swam into it anyway.

For three days, he saw nothing but water. The surface was calm, the kind of calm that meant the weather was thinking about changing. The sun burned above. He dove deep to find cooler layers, where the pressure settled against his shell like an old hand. At night, the stars were so bright they nearly hurt. He did not understand this, but he had learned not to question it.

The hunger came early. A school of fish scattered past, and he caught one—two, quick movements of his mouth. They were small and thin, and he would need more, but they kept him moving. Moving was what mattered. The current would not wait for hunger to pass.

On the fourth day, the water changed. It became rougher, choppy, the sky above it growing gray at the edges. The turtle had seen storms before. He dove again, deeper this time, where the water was cold and dark and still. He waited. This was patience. This was survival.

When he emerged, the wind was driving the waves into white-capped walls. He swam through them without fighting, letting the power of the ocean push him where it would. Fighting the sea was a young turtle's mistake. The old ones knew better. You moved with it, you used what it gave you, and you kept moving.

There was a pain in his left rear flipper. Something had caught him near the reef as he left—a piece of coral, perhaps, or a hook from the nets that hung near the shallows where men came. He did not think about it. Pain was information, nothing more. It meant he was still alive. It meant the flipper still worked.

The sun set. The stars came. The turtle swam.

He did not know how far the journey was. It would take months. His destination was a place he had never been but had always known—a beach on an island somewhere across the vast, terrible empty of the Pacific. Other turtles would go there too. He would not think about them now. What mattered was the next stroke of his flippers, the next breath of air, the next moment of forward movement.

The ocean was everything. It was hunger and cold and distance. It was the only thing that had ever made sense.

He swam into the darkness.
