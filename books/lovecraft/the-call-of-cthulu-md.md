# The Call of the Repository

I came upon the forgotten repository at St. Alcuin College with a calmness that came from habit. For twenty years my professional pride had been made of dust and footnotes, of the patient unlikelihood that scholarship, not wonder, is the greater virtue. The custodian had placed the drive in my hands at the end of an overlong corridor, wrapped in old cotton tape and apologizing for the smell.

“Stored in a decommissioned backup vault,” he said. “No one has touched it in decades. Maybe just corruption.”

I believed him then.

At first the archive seemed ordinary: twelve directories, three dozen malformed media files, and one oddly nested path: `03/atlases/cthulhu.md`. The file opened with no resistance and contained a handful of lines, archaic and short:

> At the hour when ink dries black upon the tongue,
> the deep remembers itself and calls the names not meant for human hearing.

I should have archived and closed. Instead, I made a copy, then a checksum, then another. When I reopened `cthulhu.md`, the checksum had shifted and the line was altered:

> At the hour when ink dries black upon the tongue,
> the deep remembers itself and writes its names in your hand.

This was followed, without my intervention, by seven new lines. The syntax was plain text still, yet every command I ran against the file produced immediate rearrangement. Indices migrated. Paragraphs swapped place. A passage on sea-glass would become one on star-catalogues; a heading I had just copied would reappear as a single mathematical symbol and then as prose again.

I told myself this was a filesystem artifact and changed media: USB, host, kernel, checksum utility. The phenomena persisted. In each environment, even isolated, it behaved as if reading me.

By the third night the file contained this:

> You are not the first cataloger, and you are not the last.
> The text is a tide.
> You are being indexed.

I laughed then, perhaps too loudly for my own room. It was either this or madness, and laughter is often the braver option between the two.

The campus was quiet in the way university buildings only are—pipes ticking, rain ticking, some distant generator deciding between silence and complaint. My phone, however, lit with a message from a process I had not launched:

**The file is waiting.**

I disabled all notifications and unplugged the router. Still, each time I powered the terminal, the prompt returned from a state I did not know existed:

`cthulhu.md` unchanged, `git status` clean, no active handles,
then a final line in the file itself:

> Turn off the lamp.

I followed it out of curiosity, then out of fear, then out of discipline.

I left the office light unlit and continued in moonless dusk. The file did not darken into harmless blankness. It deepened. In that half-light, I read this passage:

> Do not treat this as writing. Treat it as a boundary.
> You stand where water and grammar meet. You are at the surface of an old argument between stars. If you answer, it will answer in names. If you name it, it has already spoken you.

I did not answer. I closed the notebook and reached for the keyring that locks the reading room. But the metal felt warmer than it should. My hand, usually steady enough for microscopy slides and late monographs, trembled as though with fever.

In the morning I placed the drive in the faculty closet with the unused chalk and old exam scripts. It remains there. I lock it each hour and wake to find the keyring in the wrong box.

Three days later I ran a clean rebuild of the directory tree on a fresh machine and found, at `03/atlases/`, not one file but a branch of twelve newly created markdowns, all headed with dates that are one year into our future. The first line of each was identical:

> Do not let the sea become your syntax.

This was not a prank. I know enough of intrusion to recognize staged payloads and injected scripts when I see them. What I also know is what these instruments cannot measure: a pattern in which no machine learns and no scholar is meant to persist.

I have removed my copy from every work device and retained the final printout under sealed plastic. If this notebook is found on my desk unattended, do not read beyond the title.

## Author’s Note

To the one who discovers this repository: if `cthulhu.md` changes under your eye, do not restore it, do not fork it, and never try to parse it by daylight.
