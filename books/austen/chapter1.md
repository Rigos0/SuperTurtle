# Chapter I

In Pemberley Quay, where the weather is as changeable as a proposal and every shell is judged by the way it reflects the sun, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a turtle with a good shell must be in want of a mate.

Mrs. Penelope Shellby, of Pemberley Quay, had been possessed of this truth since before she could distinguish a pearl from a pebble; yet she had long ago taught herself to act surprised whenever it was uttered at her door. Her three daughters, excellent young turtles in every measurable accomplishment except prudence, all knew the ritual by heart: Mrs. Shellby would open a parcel, or a letter, or even merely a cloud of bad weather, and discover in it a matrimonial possibility.

Miss Lydia possessed the complexion of a sunset and no patience for dull men. Miss Harriet possessed exactness of accounts and no patience for foolish men. Miss Catherine possessed the kind of eyes by which one sees through falsehood and a talent for speaking in sentences that appear innocent until they are found by everyone. As for young Master Oliver, he possessed a quick mind for himself and a slow mind for all things practical.

They had but recently learned that Miss Matilda Lark, lately of the coast near Mariner’s End, had announced herself to be the aunt of a handsome young gentleman named Mr. Bingley, newly come into a profitable shell-licensing concern and a very lively opinion of his own charm. Mrs. Shellby, who preferred people to be useful before they were agreeable, observed for four minutes that a profitable concern and agreeable manners were both convenient qualities in a husband.

Mrs. Morrow, who communicated all neighbourhood intelligence in prose fit for a magistrate and pastry for a pastry-baker, declared Mr. Bingley to be not only amiable, but also "highly connected with all things." The words caused instant agitation. In this community, connected with all things meant either a godparent, a creditor, or a magistrate’s cousin, and each promised equally to Mrs. Shellby the happiness of seeing her daughters paired in due order.

When Mr. Bingley first visited, he did what gentlemen in novels often do at first: he smiled too often, praised too freely, and complimented every room as if each were newly designed for him. He admired the conservatory, the salt-glass, and the family crest (though its rays seemed to have been painted by a less candid hand than his compliments). Within three days he had called upon each of Mrs. Shellby’s acquaintances and contrived to say in their presence exactly what they most wished him to hear and nobody’s thing at all.

Mrs. Shellby confided at tea that he had called upon Miss Catherine merely to admire her view, and upon Miss Harriet to inquire whether one might invest in her ledger, which she received as high flattery. "He has manners," she said with satisfaction, "and no mean intentions. I should not object if he were to like one of these girls, provided he chooses with discernment." She then explained discernment to Mrs. Morrow’s evident relief.

Miss Catherine, who had little taste for men who arrived with compliments in both hands, found Mr. Bingley very handsome in the manner of a well-cut sail: useful, broad, and likely to be seen in every wind. She resolved, therefore, to take her cue from everyone else and be extremely civil. Her sisterly friend Lydia, who could not resist laughter, asked why she would do so when every turtle in this parish had already done so and survived.

Mrs. Penelope observed all this with maternal composure. She had long known that matrimony proceeded less from romance than from reputation, and no family was safer than the one that could secure both. Mr. Bingley, of course, seemed a most suitable man; one need only subtract a little of his readiness to approve and add a little of his family fortune. Such arithmetic, however, was never performed where ladies and tea were concerned.

No one had yet counted the number of visits Mr. Bingley paid before they discovered that he had, in truth, shown equal attention to everyone, a distinction that set everyone in a state of admirable satisfaction and secret irritation in equal measure. For while each household congratulated itself on being observed, each equally resented that it might not be the first to be chosen.

It is to be expected that a little commotion followed, if not from surprise but from relief. A girl might be called pretty, prudent, accomplished, or sensible in the morning and be all these to a dozen neighbors by nightfall; but the most extraordinary reputation remains the one that comes with a carriage, a carriage key, and an available gentleman. If anyone felt disheartened by such improvements in the world, they were at least diligent in not mentioning it.
