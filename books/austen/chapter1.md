# Chapter 1

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that every turtle with a good shell, and particularly a shell to the admiration of his neighbours, must be in want of a mate.

Mrs. Shellby of Pemberton Point had three daughters who were very decided in their opinions and two of them very decided in different directions, a circumstance that made her very lively at breakfast and very severe in the evening. Her daughters, though not all beautiful, were all amiable, and therefore, by Mrs. Shellby's standards, equally desirable; for in her view amiability might easily stand in for all other perfections if it arrived with sufficient punctuality and an elegant shell-brush.

Master Oliver, her only son, had the air of a man who expected to be approved as soon as he reached the room, which, being a very useful quality in itself, is often mistaken for virtue among relations who know no better. He was known to keep, at his own expense, an assortment of compliments as other men keep an assortment of gloves, to be produced according to the weather. Yet when he smiled, it was with all the conviction of a man who had never had cause to disbelieve himself.

Such a man entered the social conversation in the person of Mr. Bingley, newly arrived at Pemberton from the southern reefs, where his late aunt had left him a tract of very profitable kelp and an opinion of his own amiable constitution. A letter from Mrs. Morrow informed Mrs. Shellby that this young gentleman had no fewer than three occupations, all of them flourishing, and precisely one of which was so excellent as to require little attention.

"A man who can attend to all that," said Mrs. Shellby, with a smile of relieved prudence, "must of necessity be the very husband to improve a prudent family."

Beatrice, the second daughter, who measured the world by reason, laughed into her tea with too much spirit; but Elizabeth, who believed in seeing people as they were, asked whether his prosperity extended to his temper, since that mattered more in a house than any concern that sold well in ledgers. Anne, younger and less severe, replied only by looking at the shell of her tea caddy and pronouncing it untrustworthy.

During the first three mornings, Mr. Bingley called at Pemberton with such cheerful regularity that the butler began counting him by tides and the washerwoman by curtains. He praised the conservatory, admired the shell-castings, and complimented Mrs. Shellby upon her admirable management in raising a family that could not seem in danger of any moral inconvenience.

By the fifth day, Lady Myrtle had already remarked in confidence, as if speaking of weather, that he possessed not only agreeable manners but a remarkable talent for making every person feel immediately as though they had always been known to him.

"In short," said Lady Myrtle, with an expression of concern worthy of religion, "he listens with that particular attention which, if it does not secure affection at once, at least secures excellent impressions."

There were therefore many happy conjectures. Mrs. Shellby imagined, in tones fit for public announcement, that Elizabeth had found herself admired enough to merit gratitude; Beatrice said she had no objection to a man who remembered his umbrella; Oliver spoke of him as one speaks of a promising investment; and Anne observed that the neighbourhood had become astonishingly active in all the ways in which people become active when marriage is likely to become somebody else's affair.

At tea, where the room was fragrant with lemon peel, varnish, and those social truths that are never spoken in churches, Beatrice noted in silence that some inhabitants of Pemberton entered a house to observe others, while others entered with equal ceremony to be observed. Mr. Bingley, being of the former sort, had made himself very welcome indeed.

Mrs. Myrtle, after him, declared that Mr. Bingley's shell seemed almost uncommonly polished, which was either kindness or industry; both, she added, were useful traits in a young gentleman likely to marry into any respectable house.

By evening the rumour moved from drawing room to staircase, from staircase to market, and from market to the fishmongers, whose trade improved accordingly.
