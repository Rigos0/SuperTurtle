# Chapter 1

It is a universally acknowledged truth, or at least so it had become in Mervyn and Tidewater, that every turtle with an enviable carapace must be in search of an appreciative pair.

Mrs. Shellby of Pemberton Point had three very sensible daughters and one very accomplished son, Master Oliver, whose greatest accomplishments consisted of polishing his shell to a dangerous sheen and maintaining a most impenetrable opinion concerning himself. It therefore came as no surprise when she heard from Mrs. Morrow at Tidemark that Mr. Hardwick had a son, Miss Matilda, and not merely a son: a son who had inherited a profitable kelp-smelting concern and a shell sufficiently symmetrical to occasion envy in any mixed congregation.

"A shell of that caliber," said Mrs. Shellby, arranging a ribbon on her nephew’s collar, "must have a good heart to match."

Her daughter Beatrice, who had always thought ribbons a sign of weak will, rolled her eyes with sisterly tenderness. Elizabeth, ever the practical one, asked if a good heart was included with the property. Anne only laughed; she had a better understanding of the sea and fewer illusions about men.

As for Mr. Bingley — for so this unfortunate turtle was known, though the name was bestowed during a period of severe weather and bad influence — he was, when he first arrived at Pemberton, all attentiveness and salt-sparkle cheer. He called on Mrs. Shellby with all the punctuality of the tides and made such a point of praising the family’s conservatory of shell-castings that even Oliver, who suspected fraud in all cheerful compliments, was forced to admire the tact.

Within three mornings, however, there were already reports circulating with the speed of an eager gull: Mr. Bingley had visited every relative, had been seen speaking kindly of everyone, and had promised to attend tea whenever Lady Myrtle had the least pretext.

Lady Myrtle, who had once been promised to four admirers and one whale, declared she wished she could have chosen a gentler creature for her own attention and not so many admirers for his. Yet she sent a card to Mrs. Morrow recommending oysters and said that a young turtle who knows how to listen to his own conscience is the only creature fit to found a household.

Thus was the neighbourhood abuzz in the way that only it could be: outwardly concerned with weather and preserves, inwardly with who might next become a spouse to whom, and whether such developments might improve one’s own circumstances. And in a hall scented with lemon peel and varnish, where every polished shell reflected every rumor, Beatrice quietly observed that some people enter a room to admire; others to be admired.
