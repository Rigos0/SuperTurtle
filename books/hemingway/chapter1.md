# Chapter 1

He left the reef before dawn.
The stones were slick.
He held one claw close and one out.
He did it like this when he left.

This was not his first crossing.
He crossed as a young turtle, angry and fast.
He crossed again when he was older and called himself patient.
Now he crossed because he had no other way.

The lagoon behind him was loud.
Hatchlings swam in circles around weed.
An old male clicked his throat and drifted to the edge.
That male had seen two storms.
He made no questions.
No one did.

He slid past the last breaker and felt the pull.
It took him in and dropped him.
He corrected with his fore flippers and made three clean strokes.
He did not waste breath on thought.
His body remembered.

Rain came for half an hour and then stopped.
Every scar in him pulled.
He felt the old hook scar near his left fore fin.
He had lived through that pull.
The sea kept taking.
Sometimes it gave back.
He did not trust what gave.

Night came before he expected it.
He crossed a school of fish and felt their bodies strike and slide away.
They had no memory for him.
He had one for them.
He gave them room.
They opened and passed.
He crossed through.

At one point he saw a net with a looped hook.
He passed wide.
He remembered a brother who did not return.

He did not sleep on the current as before.
Sleep makes a turtle soft.
Sleep makes a turtle late.
He rolled once, then swam.
Three strokes.
One pause.
Three more.
His rhythm was all that had not failed.

The stars rose.
The south wind changed.
He angled west, then south, then west again.
The stars gave no guidance.
Only distance.
He counted by pain, not direction.
Pain did not lie.

He spoke to the water once.
"One crossing," he said.
"Nothing else."
He had promised himself he would stop there.
He crossed into darker water and stayed.

Far out, no reef.
No call.
No moon.
He floated on his back for two strokes of stillness.
Darkness had no mercy.
No mockery.
It simply went on.
So did he.

He turned his head forward.
He pushed with both fore flippers.
He was old, yes.
But he was still moving.
Not for fame.
Not for answer.
Only because the line once chosen was now the only truth.

At dawn, he crossed the same dark line, unnamed and uncounted.
