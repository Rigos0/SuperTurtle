# Chapter 1

He left the reef before dawn.
The stones were slick and still dark.
He held one claw close and one out, as he always did when leaving.

This was not his first crossing, only the last one he would admit.
He had crossed as a young turtle, full of anger, and he crossed again when he was older and thought himself patient.
Now he crossed because age had narrowed the choice to one path.

The lagoon behind him was loud with small life.
Hatchlings swam in circles around weed that moved like old rope.
An old male clicked his throat and drifted closer to the edge.
The old male had known two storms and no mistakes in those two years.
He did not ask where the old turtle was going.
No one asked anymore.

He slid past the last breaker and felt the open pull.
It took him quickly, then dropped him.
He corrected with his fore flippers and gave the water three clean strokes.
He did not waste breath thinking.
His body remembered.

Rain came for half an hour and then stopped.
The rain made every scar on him ache.
He felt the old hook scar near his left fore fin.
He had lived through that pull.
The sea kept taking and taking, and sometimes it kept giving back.
He did not trust the giving.

Night fell before he expected it.
He crossed a school of fish and felt their bodies strike and slip away.
They had no history for him. He had one for them.
He gave them room and they opened a hard moving gate.
He passed through with no praise.

At one point he found a net with a hooked loop.
He passed wide.
He remembered the brother who did not return.

He did not sleep on the current as he used to.
Sleep makes a turtle easy.
But sleep makes a turtle late.
He rolled once, then swam.
Three strokes, one pause, three more.
His rhythm was all that had not failed.

The stars rose. The south wind changed.
He angled west and then south and then west again.
The stars gave no guidance, only distance.
He kept counting by body pain instead of direction.
Pain did not lie.

He spoke to the water once, a low breath.
"One crossing," he said. "Nothing else."
He had promised himself he would stop at this thought.
He crossed into darker water and kept it.

Far out, no reef, no call, no moon.
He floated on his back for two strokes of stillness.
The dark had no mercy and no mockery.
It simply went on.
So did he.

He turned his head forward and pushed with both fore flippers.
He was old, yes.
But he was still moving.
Not for fame. Not for answer.
Only because the line once chosen was now the only truth.
