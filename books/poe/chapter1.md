You ask whether I am sleepless, and I tell you plainly that I am not a fool. I keep my accounts in order and set the same lamp each evening. If outward habits prove sanity, then I am sane.

Yet every midnight, when the city settles and the house takes one breath, a tapping comes from beneath the floorboards of my study.

At first I called it wind; then winter; then the trick of too much attention. Three taps, a pause, then two. Some nights five and silence. Never loud. Never wild. Always too exact for chance.

For a week I watched and marked each hour by candle and watch. It came only in the hollow hour: if my wife remained in the room, no sound; if she slept, it came.

I spoke of it to no one. Pride first, shame next, then silence, for fear of being called vain and weak. But pride and shame failed me. I spoke, it answered. I held my breath, it continued.

I removed a board near the hearth and found, beneath it, a clean shell, pale green and curved like an ear. I set it down, and the tapping rose from another seam, as if the house had moved while still standing still.

I kept charts as I would keep bills and weather notes. The pattern held: three, two, one pause, three, then two, then two, repeated across nights.

At times I thought I invented the noise to excuse nerves. At others I feared I had named a thing and so made it live. When I left the room and returned, it waited with a louder first tap, as if counting my distance from it.

I asked my wife to move me to another room. She laughed and moved two chairs. The sound followed nowhere. In the morning she asked why I drew chalk figures. I told her I measured drafts.

Tonight it changed. I pressed my ear to the board and heard not mere tapping, but command. Quick bursts, then a silence so complete I heard my blood in my wrists. The shell heard nothing. Yet the room answered from three corners at once.

Now the taps rose at doorframe, chair-leg, even the lamp-brass: three, two, one pause, two. When I stood, it waited. When I sat, it resumed.

By two, many boards answered: dull, ringing, soft, hollow. In each held breath I knew whose voice I feared.

At half past two the pattern broke: three quick, two quick, one long, three quick again, then a long knock. I knelt and pressed my palm to the boards. They answered, not to my weight, but to my touch.

You should call it what you will, but I know I kept hearing: not a random sound, not a trick of draft, but design. This house has a mind, patient and sharpened by stone. It has chosen my sleep.

Even as I write, the three knocks return: one, two, three—then the longest silence of all, before the next command arrives.
