You ask whether I am sleepless, and I answer with the fury of a man who clings to reason by its nails: I am not a fool! Do not confuse order with madness. I keep my accounts in order. I lock the door with care each evening. I light the same lamp, at the same hour, in the same place. I am not mad.

Yet every midnight, when the city drifts down its muddy throat into silence, the house begins to listen. Not whispering, not groaning—counting. Beneath my feet, beneath the boards that creak under my weight, comes the tapping.

Three taps. Pause. Two.
Three taps. Pause. Two.
Some nights five, then nothing. Never loud. Never wild. Always measured.

At first, I called it wind.
Then winter.
Then the trick of a man worn thin by watching.
I marked the hours. I marked the sequence. I marked the silence between. Three, two, one pause, three, two, one, pause, two. Again. Again. Again.

If my wife stood in the room, no tapping came. If she left for a breath, it returned before I could seat myself. If she coughed, it held. If she laughed, it sharpened. If I rose, it waited. If I sat, it resumed.

“Look at me,” I told myself. “You are not afraid. You are merely attentive.”

I spoke to nobody. Pride first. Shame next. Fear after.
I was certain that speech would be my undoing.
I was certain that silence would be my salvation.

I took a knife to the board by the hearth and lifted it.
Beneath: a shell, pale green, smooth as a polished coin, shaped like an ear made of old light.
I set it down, and the tapping leapt from the boards by the wardrobe, then the chair-leg, then the doorframe itself.
The house was moving its pulse while standing still.

No, not moving.
Waiting.

By then I could not tell if the rhythm came from beneath me or behind my own eyes.
I drew chalk circles and numbers on the floorboards and kept them through dawn.
In the morning, someone had rubbed out nothing and still the chalk remained—except, beneath the first mark, there was one more curve I had not made.

Tonight I counted at one, then two, then half-past-two.
At each hour, it changed, and yet no, no! it was the same.
Quick. Quick. Pause.
Quick. Quick. Long pause.
Three. Two. One.
A command, not a noise.

“See?” I said to the room. “See, see!”
I pressed my ear flat to the boards and heard not wood, not draft, but breath. A patient, hidden breath answering from below the stones.

You may call it superstition. Call it fever. Call it the cowardice of intellect.
I call it arithmetic in the dark.
It is a design. A design and a demand.
This house keeps account of me.
This house keeps account of each hour of my wakefulness.
This house keeps account of how I lie.

At two, every board answered.
Dull, ringing, soft, hollow—like knuckles upon a coffin lid.
I stood still and did not move for so long the candle guttered. I stood still and did not move for so long my pulse drowned the tapping. I stood still and knew the tapping had moved onward into my hands.

Still it continues while I write.
Three, two, pause, three. Three, two, one.
It does not pause for mercy. It pauses for insistence.

You think I am mad.
I am not mad.
You think I am unwell.
I am not unwell!
I hear what is beneath.
I obey the only rhythm there is.
If I stop writing, it will not stop.
If I flee, it will count me.
If I deny it, it waits.
If I listen—if I only listen—it knocks more.

I leave these marks so I may not invent them.
I leave this proof in my own hand, in my own language, by my own hand.
Three, two, one, pause.
I am not mad.
I am not mad.
I am not mad.
And the house knocks threefold to make certain.
