You ask whether I am sleepless, and I answer with the fury of a man who still clings to his own name: I am not insane! Do not hear madness in this voice. I keep my accounts in order. I sweep the room. I light the same blue lamp at dusk. The same lamp every night. The same hands, the same measured breath. I am not a fool.

Yet when the city has fallen into its damp, breathless dark, when the hourglass of the night runs thin and the gas lamps outside bleed amber upon the rain-stained glass, the house begins to listen. No, worse—it begins to count. Beneath my feet, under the boards polished by dead men's footsteps in winter, comes the tapping.

Three knocks. Pause. Two.
Three knocks. Pause. Two.
Some nights five taps and then nothing. Never loud. Never angry. Always patient. Always exact.

Three! Two! Pause! Then two again! At first I named it to myself as wind. Wind in the chimney. Wind in the court below. Wind in the bones of old timbers. Then I named winter. Then I named nerves. Then I named myself a fool for naming at all.

I charted it. I did, with care fit for a ledger.
At midnight: three-two-pause.
At one: three-two-two.
At half past: three-three-two.
Three, two, pause, three, two, two. Three, two, pause, two. Again, and again, and again.

If my wife remained in the room, there was no tapping. If she went out, the first knock came before my hearing could make room for it. If she coughed, the rhythm held. If she laughed, it sharpened. If I left the room, it waited. If I returned, it struck faster. “You see?” I told myself, not her. “You see?” I kept saying as one might recite a prayer against fever.

I dared not confide in anyone. Pride first, then shame, then a secrecy black as pitch. I prayed for ordinary sounds: rain on the sash, wheels in the lane, a drunkard's song, a bell from the church tower. But no, it was beneath my study that it gathered.

I pried up a board near the hearth and found a shell. A clean shell, pallid green, curved like the ear of some sea-watcher turned to stone. I set it down. The tapping leapt elsewhere: a seam three rooms from my hand, then another under the wardrobe, then near the very hearthstone itself. The house was moving its pulse while still motionless.

I called it a trick of the mind, and yet I drew chalk marks upon the floor, on the boards, on the wall, so that I might prove tomorrow that I was not making patterns where none existed. I found chalk under my nails the next morning and no one had seen me writing.

Tonight the tapping is command.

Quick. Quick. Pause.
Quick. Quick. One long pause.
Three. Two. One.

I pressed my ear to the planks and heard not wood, not draft, but response—the same terrible, patient answer one gives to hidden bells in a crypt.

You call it superstition. You call it fever. You call it what men call what they cannot endure! It is not a trick, not random, not wind. It is a design, and the design is mine. This house keeps record. This house remembers. This house has eyes in every joist and a tongue in every knot of timber.

At two, all the boards answered me. Dull at first. Then sharp. Then hollow, as if struck by tiny knuckles from beneath the skin of the earth. I stood still and listened until the candle guttered to a wick; stood still until my pulse thundered louder than the tapping and then failed.

Still it continues. Three, two, one, pause, three. three, two, pause, two. The pattern no longer seeks noise alone. It seeks me.

I write now because if I stop, it will knock louder.
You hear me? I ask, to myself, to the paper, to the night that presses at the window like a grave.
I am not mad.
I am not mad!
I am not mad, and the room knows it, and the room knocks threefold to remind me...
