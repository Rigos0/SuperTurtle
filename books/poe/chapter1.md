You ask whether I am sleepless, and I tell you plainly that I am not a fool. I eat at proper hours, keep my accounts in order, and set the same chair beside the same lamp each evening. If outward habits prove sanity, then I am sane.

Yet every midnight, after the city quiets and my house becomes a single breathing thing, a tapping comes from beneath the floorboards of my study.

At first I called it wind. Then I blamed winter shrinkage. Then, when wind and winter both failed to explain it, I blamed my own attention. Three soft taps, a pause, two more. Then again, on a later night, five taps and silence. Not loud, never loud. Always deliberate, always too neat for coincidence.

For a week I watched and counted. I set a candle aside, a watch in hand, and marked every hour when the sound arrived. It came only in the dead portion of night, never with guests, never if my wife remained in the room. As soon as she slept, it came. As soon as I stood alone at my desk, it came.

I spoke of it to no one for pride, then to no one for shame, then to no one at all, for fear they would laugh and call me vain. But the house and I no longer shared one language. I spoke, it answered; I held my breath, it continued.

I removed a board near the hearth. Not broken boards, not rotted. Sounding timber. Under that board: a small shell, clean as if newly dried, pale green and curved like an ear. I lifted it and there was no sound. I set it down and the tapping resumed from another seam, farther off, as if the thing had changed rooms while staying still.

Do not mistake this for superstition. I kept charts. I measured intervals as I would market dates. I timed each set against the old hall clock. The pattern remained:
three, two, one pause, three; then two, then two again. The same for nights.

At times I fancied I invented the noise to excuse my own nerves. At other times I feared I had given it a life by naming it. Yet whenever I left the room and returned, it waited with a louder first tap, as though counting my distance from it.

I told my wife to move rooms tonight, to see if another floor would still speak. She obeyed, amused. The sound followed nowhere. In the morning she asked why I paced and why the room was filled with chalk marks. I laughed and told her I measured drafts. She kissed my brow and left.

So yes, I am a vain man, and yes, I am perhaps too precise for comfort. But it is not vanity to stand before what will not obey me and still keep my notebook.

Tonight, I pressed my ear to the board and heard—not merely tapping—but a rhythm of intent. Once, it gave one long run of quick notes, then a stop so complete I heard only my own blood, then another pair. It was no random tapping. It was insistence.

You see why I am uneasy? No. You should not call it hysteria. You should call it fact. It has chosen me to hear it, and in that choice there is no mercy.

If this is madness, then madness is punctual, patient, and under my floor.
