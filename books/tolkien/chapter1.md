# The Shellmarillion, Book I: The Song of the Hallowed Shell

In the age before age, before light sought witness in darkness, there was only the Still-Water, wide and listening.
Above it stood the Timeless One whose mind was older than the first fire and swifter than the first dawn. He spoke once, and in that speaking was a summons:  

“Let there be song.”

Then came forth the Ainur, bright spirits of the First Mind, and gathered as a ring in the silence above the deeps.
From their choirs arose wind and tide, shade and ember, and form awoke.

First sang Oromë, and at his bright cry leaped forth Oromíë, Turtle of Beginnings.
Where her shell passed, stone remembered its burden and yielded valleys, ridges, and sleeping loams.
Then Nánë sang in silver cadence, and pale shells rose from nowhere and drifted in ordered rings, becoming the first measure of heavens.

Their song persisted, and each harmony birthed a world within a world.
A note of Varda set pearl-lights to the dark, and they took stations as stars.
Another note from Tulkas rang like laughter, and from that ringing came warm places for fire to gather.
Thus by singing did the Choir weave a dwelling for futures not yet dreamed.

Last among the proudest strode Melkor, lion-hearted and hard.
He sought not only beauty but mastery, and he struck the deep with iron delight.
From that wound arose a blackened ridge, and for a season the waters fled their appointed courses.
Yet the Great One did not unmake him. He bent the roughness not by rage, but by a mercy long as winter stars.
Thus was sorrow turned, not spared.

Then answered gentler minds, Tulkas in laughter and Nienor in clear waters.
Their voices met as brook and bank.
Discord was not cast away; it was given task.

The world opened wider.
Sea found coast; coast found river; wind found wings where mountain and marsh had no names.
One vast Turtle rose from the dark, patient as epochs, and bore in shell the turning of seasons.
In secret tongue the Choir named him Valandor, Wanderer Between Days, for by his revolving stride daylight and night were weighed and returned.

From the grinding of shelled backs against basalt and foam came the first gardens.
In their mud stood the First Tree, and in its rings the song lay hidden like prophecy.
By each ring the shell-memory learned that every joy casts a shadow, and every shadow teaches.

Long ages passed before the first peoples heard the old chorus.
Yet those with patient listening caught a deeper rhythm beneath storm and tide.

So it is told to-watchful folk that the world is not yet ended, for the Song does not cease.
It is sung by many voices, and beneath all is the turning of shelled choirs in hidden deep.
When dread comes, remember the Shell of Beginnings.  
When your road is broken, attend the patient tracks of the turtle beneath your feet.  
For in the end, endurance is the highest victory, and the patient earth is stronger than proud thunder.
