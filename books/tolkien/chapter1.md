# The Shellmarillion, Book I: The Song of the First Shell

In the age before first ages, ere thought had a face to bear, there lay only the Great Silence and the Wide Water beneath it, dark as dream and patient beyond reckoning.  
There sat Ilúvatar above the deeps, and in His thought were more than stars; there was hunger for making, and it burned.

And It came to pass that He spoke:  

“Let us sing.”

And the Ainur were wakened from the silence, bright as flame and cold as moonfire. They took their stations in a ring above the dark, and their voices were as many streams descending one stone-choir.  
Out of their song rose wind, and out of wind came tide; out of tide rose shadow, ember, and shape.

And Oromë took his harp first, and made a keen music of awakening.  
From his measure leapt forth Oromyel, Turtle of the First Burden, who bore the weight of valleys and the first memory of stone. Wherever her shell brushed the waiting deep, ridges rose and hollows accepted water, and mountains learned the stillness of being.

Then Nárë, the silver-tongued, sang in a slender and patient cadence, and pale shells gathered from nowhere into circles within circles, as beads upon an unseen thread.  
So were the first heavens measured, and their pathways set in quiet law.

Then Varda sang once. The deep took light as if a veil had been torn from the face of night. Pearled fire came to the waters, and that fire stood steadfast as stars.  
Then Tulkas laughed in joy, and where he touched, heat found hearth and flame found a place to stay.

So the Choir wrought out the world by will and song, and the world answered them in wonder.

Last came Melkor in pride. He came late, and came in might, and made his note a hard, bright wheel that tore at the borderlands of the making.  
He struck the deep with wrath for dominion, and a long dark spine of ruin rose where calm seas had wandered.  
Then the waters scattered, and many things were disordered.

Yet not by unmaking was His will answered, but by mercy older than grief.  
Ilúvatar heard the dissonance and wove it into the pattern, setting it hard as iron lest it be forgotten, and so the broken thing endured, that it might teach.

Yavanna and Nienna answered with voices like moss and rain; their tones were soft, and no less potent for gentleness.  
The Choir did not cast discord away. It bent it toward the edge of the great design, and from that turning came paths no proud heart had dreamed.

Then the world grew broad beneath the song.  
Sea found coast and coast found river; wind found wings where there had been no hills to raise them. Marsh and mountain and plain stood forth in succession, each accepting its own name in secret.

And from the deep arose a single ancient turtle, vast as a darkened moon, who bore upon his shell the wheel of seasons.  
The Choir named him Valandor, the Bearer-Between-Days.  
By his patient going, daylight and darkness were weighed and returned in their seasons.

From the grinding of shell and stone came the first gardens.  
The mud of their making remembered and held the hymn in rings, and in that pattern rose the first Tree, whose bark was old as longing and whose leaves spoke the future as wind speaks the sea.

Long were the years ere the Children of Later-Era heard that first song, and some heard it only as thunder, and some as comfort.  
Yet the sharpest-heard among them knew another music beneath the noise of weather and sorrow: a turning, low and unyielding, as of shells beneath the sea.

Thus is it told in the elder tongue, as we have heard it from elder ears:  
The Song did not cease when the first choirs were stilled.  
It abides in the hidden places, and where the world seems broken, it yet endures.

Where fear has made your road hard, remember the Shell of Beginnings.  
Where pride has bent your purpose awry, look to the patient track of turtle-belly upon stone.  
For in the end, endurance is the oldest wisdom, and the longest mercy of the earth is made of patient backs and keeping time.
