The bell over my office door gave a metallic protest when the rain knocked at the glass. I sat behind my desk, tie loosened, coffee gone cold, deciding whether another night on this street counted as work or punishment.

In this city, night had a voice like gravel in a drawer.

She came in before I could pretend I was too busy.

A dame in an olive trench coat, lipstick bright as emergency paint, eyes dark as an alley with no witness. Her steps were careful, too careful for someone used to fear. Her legs, though, betrayed the myth: sea-turtle limbs, all the way down, long and jointed, as if the ocean had signed her into the world without asking the city if it approved.

"You’re Shellowe?"

"Depends who asks," I said.

She came to the desk and slid an envelope. "Julian is my brother. He disappeared after a meeting at the Red Lantern warehouse."

I weighed the envelope with a fingertip. Photo, satchel strap, bus ticket, a map with three marks.

"Any note?"

"One line on my answering service. Follow the gulls at dawn."

"Gulls don’t know loyalty. They know garbage." I put the envelope down. "Who sent this?"

She swallowed, jaw tight. "A broker named Crow. He calls himself harmless until he needs money from the dead."

I lit a cigarette.

Julian looked twenty-something hopeful, clean enough for a church brochure, expensive enough for a bad one. Hopefulness is cheap in this town, but it never came in installments. It comes all at once, usually before things go wrong.

I asked what she carried.

"A satchel. He said it held names. Just numbers at first, then names with no last names."

"People with names are expensive. People with no surnames are easier to bury."

She sat down and let the silence do the speaking. Her voice came back like a dropped coin: "I had two good years because he worked too hard and believed in receipts. My brother thinks in rules until rules kill him."

Outside, rain hit the window in thin straight lines, as if the whole avenue had decided to weep in a hurry.

"How much can you pay?"

She slid a roll of bills. "Enough," she said, "for someone who can move between worlds."

I didn’t smile. "If I do this, we start before dawn at Pier Twelve. No theater. No miracles. If he’s alive, we get him out. If he isn’t, we force the gulls to sing for somebody who still answers to the law."

She nodded once, and then something in her face went still, hard as ice in a back alley. "If I’d looked like anyone else, I wouldn’t have come here."

"Maybe that’s the point," I said.

She stood, put on her hat, and left with those long, patient limbs folding in and out like a tide.

When the door shut, the room felt borrowed. I wrote a line in my notebook.

When a woman says she’s come for one brother and not for glory, she usually means she wants the city to admit it owes her an answer.

I kept my coat on the chair and waited for first light.
