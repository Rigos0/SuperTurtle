Gregor Samsa woke because the kettle hissed, and for one ordinary instant he allowed himself to assume this meant only a delayed morning. The blue strip on his wall calendar still marked departure at 7:10, and the left margin held the office’s last reminder, written in a hand already smudged by humidity.

He tried to raise himself and discovered resistance at his side. Something hard pressed against his chest; the blanket had shifted, revealing a shape that was no longer singularly his. There was a dull, segmented rasp under the skin and an edge where his shoulder used to slope. He moved one limb and then another; there were too many, and each carried a different weight. It sounded like furniture dragged over tile.

This was either a practical problem with the mattress springs or a fever. He had suffered both kinds before. He tested the second by clearing his throat and heard a scraping note answer back, as if a drawer had gone unlubricated. He lay down again.

There was a knock. No one asked permission before it, which was the first indication that the day had changed.

“Gregor, you are late,” Clara said. “Father has already called the office twice.”

She did not step in immediately. She stood by the frame with her hand to the wall, as if measuring whether this was a room and not furniture.

“I am not late,” he wanted to answer, and reached for language. The shape where his mouth had been behaved like folded leather and could not make the old sound.

His mother came in with a small bowl. She set it by the chair and kept her eyes on the floorboards.

“Maybe he has the flu,” she called.

“A shell does not take the flu,” said his father from the hallway. “Should we call the clinic or the police?”

It was not clear which answer was expected. Gregor had found that in life with his mother there was rarely a wrong tone, only incorrect timing.

His mother asked if he could drink. He lowered one unfamiliar limb and tried to guide the bowl with his mouth, but the dish was pulled back three times. The room accepted this like a routine weather report: not ideal, but within tolerance.

The office called at 9:17. Clara took the message beside the door, speaking into the receiver as if she might keep sound separate from the room.

“Yes, he is unwell. No, he is not contagious. No, he is still in his room.”  
“No, he should have left by now.”  
“Yes, yes, the route sheets are on the desk.”

Afterward father asked for a doctor, then added in the same breath that the locksmith might be less expensive.

By lunch, there was a list pinned beside the bed: doctor, insurance, landlord, office, brother’s school fees. His mother checked each item with a finger, while Gregor listened and kept his breathing shallow to avoid setting dust loose.

No one called him a monster. The language in this household had never required nouns when verbs would do. They asked whether he had vomited, whether he could sign papers, whether he still intended to miss his route. He could not answer any of it and did not intend to learn why.

The kettle hissed itself out, then quieted. The room held him at arm’s length. Gregor fixed his eyes on the office memo at the top of the bed, where the ink was still legible through his damp breath.

There was still time to catch a train, if one had been made for him.
