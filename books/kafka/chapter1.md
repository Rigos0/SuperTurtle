Gregor Samsa woke because the kettle hissed, and for one comfortable second everything seemed correct. The tea was late, the winter light was gray, and his route calendar still showed 7:10 in red at the top of the page.

He opened his eyes and discovered an unfamiliar pressure in his shell, as if a crate had been bolted beneath him in the night. His right side bulged. A hard ridge crossed his chest. Then he tried to rise and felt not two legs but six, then eight, moving with a dry, uncertain click.

“Another bad night,” he thought, clinging to that explanation. “Only a bad night.”

He cleared his throat and heard a scrape of shell against his teeth.

The door answered before he could compose himself. Clara knocked and spoke through the wood as if she were calling from a corridor rather than a home.

“Gregor, you are late. Papa says the office called again.”

He reached for words, then found the wrong shape where his tongue should have been: a dark, folded opening with three wet, flexible ridges. No ordinary language came through.

The door opened anyway. His mother stepped in first, then his father. The father, who trusted invoices more than surprises, looked from the bed to the doorway and then back, as if deciding which was less difficult.

“If it is fever, it is heavy,” he said.

“It is not fever,” his mother answered, though she offered no better word.

Names did not help Gregor. He had built his life on schedules and signatures. Today no form recognized what sat beneath his blanket: a swollen, segmented body, a shell changed beyond use, and a voice like wet glass.

He pointed a stiff, narrow leg toward the wall calendar. Tuesday’s routes were underlined in blue, exactly where he had left them before dawn.

Clara stepped forward with a bowl of water and stopped. She did not cry; she only withdrew her hand as if the bowl itself might become strange. Gregor lowered his leg and found balance now came from unfamiliar places. The room tilted once, then steadied.

His mother crossed herself, then asked if he could eat. His father, practical as ever, ordered a doctor and then a locksmith, as if one might mend shame and the other might fix the household door.

The office called again before noon. Through the crack in the wall, Clara lowered the mouthpiece and said yes, Gregor would be excused, then turned away without meeting his eyes.

By noon the house had become a corridor of soft instructions and longer pauses. Nobody asked whether Gregor was frightened. They asked only whether the morning had passed without too much trouble.

Gregor said nothing. He lay still, counting the hours, his office papers untouched, his new legs folded, and accepted that he had not missed a train or an appointment at all. A new department of life had opened, and it required no forms.
