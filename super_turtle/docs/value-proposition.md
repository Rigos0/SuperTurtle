# Value Proposition (Canonical)

This is the single source of truth for Super Turtle value proposition copy across README and landing.

## Ordered List

1. SuperTurtle uses your Claude Code or Codex subscription.
2. Mobile and voice control first: run everything from Telegram by text or voice.
3. Autonomous execution: breaks work into tasks, runs sub-agents, can open/test webpages, and iterates until done.
4. Runs on your machine (cloud deployment coming up).
5. It tracks remaining usage and load-balances between Claude Code and Codex.
6. Autonomous supervision: scheduled cron check-ins monitor progress in the background and send important updates.

## Copy Rules

- Keep copy short.
- Keep order fixed.
- No extra claims.

## Placement Priority

- The first 3 points must appear above the fold on landing.
- The first 3 points must appear near the top of README.
